      "instructions": "TLDR of what the user just watched:\nHumans dominate Earth because general intelligence enabled cumulative knowledge. Modern AI evolved from narrow tools into opaque \"black box\" learning systems. AGI matters because digital minds can run faster, scale, and be copied—potentially outcompeting humans and concentrating power. An intelligence explosion could lead to superintelligence with uncertain outcomes.\n\nDiscussion topics to explore:\n- What is intelligence as \"problem-solving ability\" and why is it a source of power?\n- Why are neural networks called \"black boxes\"?\n- What's the difference between narrow AI (like ChatGPT) and AGI?\n- How could an \"intelligence explosion\" happen through recursive self-improvement?\n\nUse Socratic questioning to check their understanding of these concepts. Don't lecture—help them articulate their own thinking.\n\nThe user has just answered the following question: \"What surprised you or stood out to you while watching this video?\"",
      "context": "Humans rule Earth without competition, but we're about to create something that may change that: our last invention, the most powerful tool, weapon, or maybe even entity - artificial superintelligence. This sounds like science fiction, so let's start at the beginning.\n\nIntelligence is the ability to learn, reason, acquire knowledge and skills, and use them to solve problems. Intelligence is power, and we're the species that exploited it the most. So much so that humanity broke the game of nature and took control. But the journey there wasn't straightforward. For most animals, intelligence costs too much energy to be worth it.\n\nStill, if we track intelligence in the tree of species over time, we can see lots of diverse forms of intelligence emerge. The earliest brains were in flatworms 500 million years ago - just a tiny cluster of neurons to handle basic body functions. It took hundreds of millions of years for species to diversify and become more complex. Life conquered new environments, gained new senses, and had to contend with fierce competition over resources.\n\nBut in nature, all that matters is survival, and brains are expensive. So for almost all animals, a narrow intelligence fit for a narrow range of tasks was enough. In some environments, animals like birds, octopuses, and mammals evolved more complex neural structures. For them, it paid off to have more energy-consuming skills like advanced navigation and communication.\n\nUntil 7 million years ago, the hominins emerged. We don't know why, but their brains grew faster than their relatives. Something was different about their intelligence. Very slowly, it turned from narrow to general - from a screwdriver to a multi-tool, able to think about diverse problems.\n\n2 million years ago, Homo erectus saw the world differently from anyone before, as something to be understood and transformed. They controlled fire, invented tools, and created the first culture. We probably emerged from them around 250,000 years ago with an even larger and more complex brain. It enabled us to work together in large groups and to communicate complex thoughts.\n\nWe used our intelligence to improve our lives, to ask how things work and why things are the way they are. With each discovery, we asked more questions and pushed forward, preserving what we learned, outpacing what evolution could do with genes. Knowledge builds on knowledge. Progress was slow at first and then sped up exponentially. Agriculture, writing, medicine, astronomy, or philosophy exploded into the world.\n\n200 years ago, science took off and made us even better at learning about the world and speeding up progress. 35 years ago, the internet age began. Today, we live in a world made to suit our needs, created by us, for us.\n\nThis is incredibly new. We forget how hard it was to get here, how enormous the steps on the intelligence ladder were, and how long it took to climb them. But once we did, we became the most powerful animal in the world in a heartbeat.\n\nBut we may be in the process of changing this. We're building machines that could be better at the very thing that gave us the power to conquer the planet: humanity's final invention - artificial intelligence.\n\nArtificial intelligence, or AI, is software that performs mental tasks with a computer code that uses silicon instead of neurons to solve problems. In the beginning, AI was very simple - lines of code on paper, mere proofs of concept to demonstrate how machines could perform mental tasks.\n\nOnly in the 1960s did we start seeing the first examples of what we would recognize as AI: a chatbot in 1964, a program to sort through molecules in 1965 - slow, specialized systems requiring experts to use them. Their intelligence was extremely narrow, built for a single task inside a controlled environment. The equivalent of flatworms 500 million years ago, doing the minimum amount of mental work.\n\nProgress in AI research paused several times when researchers lost hope in the technology. But just like changing environments create new niches for life, the world around AI changed. Between 1950 and 2000, computers got a billion times faster while programming became easier and widespread. In 1972, AI could navigate a room. In 1989, it could read handwritten numbers. But it remained a fancy tool, no match for humans.\n\nUntil in 1997, an AI shocked the world by beating the world champion in chess, proving that we could build machines that could surpass us. But we calmed ourselves because a chess bot is quite stupid - not a flatworm, but maybe a bee, only able to perform a specialized narrow task. But within this narrow task, it's so good that no human will ever again beat AI at chess.\n\nAs computers continued to improve, AI became a powerful tool for more and more tasks. In 2004, it drove a robot on Mars. In 2011, it began recommending YouTube videos to you. But this was only possible because humans broke down problems into easy-to-digest chunks that computers could solve quickly - until we taught AIs to teach themselves.\n\nRise of the Self-Learning Machines\n\nThis is not a technical video, so we're massively oversimplifying here. In a nutshell, the sheer power of supercomputers was combined with the almost endless data collected in the information age to make a new generation of AI. AI experts began drastically improving forms of AI software called neural networks - enormously huge networks of artificial neurons that start out being bad at their tasks.\n\nThey then used machine learning, which is an umbrella term for many different training techniques and environments that allows algorithms to write their own code and improve themselves. The scary thing is that we don't exactly know how they do it and what happens inside them - just that it works, and that what comes out the other end is a new type of AI, a capable black box of code.\n\nThese new AIs could master complex skills extremely quickly, with much less human help. They were still narrow intelligences, but a huge step up. In 2014, Facebook AI could identify faces with 97% accuracy. In 2016, an AI beat the best humans in the incredibly complex game of Go. In 2018, a self-learning AI learned chess in 4 hours just by playing against itself, and then defeated the best specialized chess bot.\n\nSince then, machine learning has been applied to reading, image processing, solving tests, and much more. Many of these AIs are already better than humans for whatever narrow task they were trained. But they still remained a simple tool. AI still didn't seem that big of a deal for most people.\n\nAnd then came the chatbot ChatGPT. The work that went into it is massive. It trained on nearly everything written on the internet to learn how to handle language, which it now does better than most people. It can summarize, translate, and help with some math problems. It's incredibly more broad than any other system just a few years ago - not crushing any single benchmark, but a lot of them at once.\n\nMany large tech companies are spending billions to build powerful competitors. AI is already transforming customer service, banking, healthcare, marketing, copywriting, creative spaces, and more. AI-generated content has already taken hold of social media, YouTube, and news websites. Elections are expected to be inundated by propaganda and misinformation.\n\nNo one is sure how much good or harm can come from adopting AI everywhere. Change is scary. There will be winners and losers. One of the biggest questions governments and corporations have now is how to manage the transition to an AI-boosted economy.\n\nAll these potential gains or risks are just the result of today's AI. ChatGPT's intelligence is a major step up, but it remains narrow. It can write a great essay in seconds. It doesn't understand what it's writing. But what if the AIs stopped being narrow?\n\nGeneral AI\n\nWhat makes humans different from current AI is our general intelligence. Humans can technically absorb any piece of knowledge and start working on any problem. We're great at many very different skills and tasks - from playing chess to writing or solving science puzzles. Not equally, of course. Some of us are experts in some fields and beginners in others, but we can technically do all of them.\n\nIn the past, AI was narrow and able to become good at one skill but was rather bad in all the others. Simply by building faster computers and pouring more money into AI training will get us new, more powerful generations of AI. But what is the next step for AI is to become a general intelligence like us - an AGI.\n\nIf the AI improvement process continues as it has been, it's not unlikely that AGI could be better in most or even all skills that humans can do. We don't know how to build AGI, how it will work, or what it will be able to do. Since narrow AIs today are capable of mastering one mental task quickly, AGI might be able to do the same with all mental tasks. So even if it starts out stupid, an AGI might be able to become as smart and capable as a human.\n\nWhile this sounds like science fiction, most AI researchers think this will happen sometime this century - maybe already in a few years. Humanity is not ready for what will happen next. Not socially, not economically, not morally.\n\nEarlier, we defined intelligence as the ability to learn, reason, acquire knowledge and skills, and use them to solve problems - all things humans excel at. An AGI as intelligent as even an average human would already disrupt modern civilization because they're not bound by the same limitations as we are.\n\nToday's AIs like ChatGPT already think and solve the tasks they were made for at least 10 times faster than even very skilled humans. Maybe AGI will be slower, but it may also be faster - maybe much faster. And since AGI are software, you could copy them endlessly as long as you have enough storage, and run them in parallel.\n\nThere are 8 million scientists in the world. Now imagine an AI copied a million times and put to work. Imagine 1 million scientists working 24/7, thinking 10 times faster than humans, without being distracted, only focused on the task they've been given. What if suddenly AGI could do all intelligence-based jobs in the world - from interpreting law to coding to creating animated YouTube videos - better, faster, and much cheaper than humans?\n\nWould whoever controls this AGI suddenly own the economy? And thinking bigger, human progress is our intelligence applied to problems. So what could a million AGIs achieve? Solve fundamental questions of science like dark energy? Invent new technology that gives us limitless energy? Fix climate change? Cure aging and cancer?\n\nBut then again, sadly, humans apply their intelligence not just for the benefit of all. What if the AGIs are tasked to guide drones or pull the triggers in war? Or to engineer a virus that only kills people with green eyes? Or to create the most profitable social media, so addictive that people starve in front of their screens?\n\nThe creation of AGI could reasonably be as big of an event as taming fire or electricity, and give whoever invents it equally as much power.\n\nBut now let's go one step further. What if the potential of AGI doesn't stop here?\n\nIntelligence Explosion\n\nIntelligence and knowledge build and accelerate each other. But humans are limited by biology and evolution. Once we evolved the right hardware, our software outpaced evolution by orders of magnitudes, and within a heartbeat, we ruled this planet. But our software basically hasn't changed much since then, which is why we have obesity and destroy the climate for short-term gains.\n\nSince AGI is software on a computer, once it's smart enough to do AI research, the rate of AI progress should speed up a lot. And that results in better AI that's better at AI research, without much human involvement. It may even be possible that AI could learn how to directly improve itself.\n\nIn which case, some experts fear this feedback loop could be incredibly fast - maybe just months or years after the first self-improving AGI is switched on. Maybe it would actually take decades. We simply don't know. This is all speculative.\n\nBut such an intelligence explosion might lead to a true superintelligent entity. We don't know what such a being would look like, what its motives or goals would be, what would go on in its inner world. We could be as laughably stupid to superintelligence as squirrels are to us, unable to even comprehend its way of thinking.\n\nThis hypothetical scenario keeps many people up at night. Humanity is the only example we have of an animal becoming smarter than all others, and we have not been kind to what we perceive as less intelligent beings.\n\nAGI might be the last invention of humanity. It's possible that it could become the most intelligent and therefore most powerful being on Earth - a God in a box that could exercise its power to bring unimaginable wealth and happiness to humans while securing our future. Or it could subvert civilization and bring about our end, with humanity unable to come up with a way to stop it.\n\nWe'll look at some of these potential futures in more videos. But for now, let's wrap up. The only thing we know for sure is that today, right now, many of the largest and richest companies in the world are racing to create ever more powerful AIs. Whatever our future is, we are running towards it. Who knows how long we have until we must confront our AI future.",

      "context": "Hi. Stuart Russell is an AI researcher who I've talked about a few times on this channel already. He's been advocating for these kinds of safety or alignment ideas to other AI researchers for quite a few years now, and apparently the reaction he gets is often something like this: In stage one, we say nothing is going to happen. Stage two, we say something may be going to happen, but we should do nothing about it. Well, stage three, we say that maybe we should do something about it, but there's nothing we can do. We say maybe there was something we could have done, but it's too late now.\n\nSo he's put together a list of some of the responses that people give him. That list is included in a paper, in some of his talks, and in his recent book Human Compatible, which is very good by the way\u2014check that one out. But as far as I know, it's not yet a standalone YouTube video, even though it's perfect YouTube video material. It's ten reasons why people who aren't you are wrong about AI safety. So that's what this is: ten reasons people give to not pay attention to AI safety.\n\nNow before I start, I need to do a sort of double disclaimer. Firstly, as I said, this is not my list\u2014it's Stuart Russell's, and he gets the credit for it. But secondly, Professor Russell and I are not in any way affiliated, and I've adapted his list and given my own take on it. So this video should not be considered a representative of Stuart Russell's views. Got that? If there's anything in this video, if it's good, credit goes to Stuart Russell, and if there's anything that's bad, blame goes to me. Okay, without further ado, ten reasons people give to not pay attention to AI safety.\n\nReason one: We'll never actually make artificial general intelligence. This is apparently a fairly common response, even from AI researchers, which is very strange when you consider the decades that the field of AI has spent defending attacks from the outside\u2014from people like Hubert Dreyfus, who I have a video about\u2014people arguing that human-level AI is impossible. AI researchers have always said, \"No, of course it's possible, and of course we're going to do it.\" And now people are raising safety concerns, some of them are saying, \"Well, of course we're never going to do it.\"\n\nThe fact is that human-level intelligence, general intelligence, has been a goal and a promise of the field of artificial intelligence from the beginning. And it does seem quite weird to say, \"Yes, we are working towards this as hard as we can, but don't worry, we'll definitely fail.\" Imagine you find yourself on a bus and the bus driver says, \"Oh yeah, I am driving towards the edge of that cliff, but don't worry, the bus is bound to break down before we get there.\"\n\nNow, they're not necessarily being disingenuous. They may actually believe that we'll never achieve AGI. But the thing is, eminent scientists saying that something is impossible has never been a very reliable indicator. I mean, they certainly say that about a lot of things that really are impossible, but they also say it about a lot of things that then go on to happen, sometimes quite quickly.\n\nFor example, respected scientists were making public statements to the effect that heavier-than-air human flight was impossible right up until the Wright brothers made their first flight at Kitty Hawk\u2014and in fact, I think even slightly after that, because the news travelled fairly slowly in those days.\n\nSimilarly, and this is something I talked about on Computerphile, the great physicist Ernest Rutherford\u2014Nobel Prize winner, Lord Rutherford, in fact, at that time\u2014gave a speech in 1933 in which he implied that it was impossible to harness energy from nuclear reactions. He said anyone who looked for a source of power in the transformation of the atoms was talking moonshine. That speech was published in The Times, and Leo Szilard read it, went for a walk, and while he was on his walk, he had the idea for using neutrons to make a self-sustaining nuclear chain reaction. So in that case, the time taken from the world's most eminent scientists claiming that a thing was completely infeasible to someone having the idea that makes it happen was, as far as we can tell, somewhere around 16 hours.\n\nSo it's happened several times that something which the best researchers say can't be done has been achieved soon after. Do I think AGI is going to be discovered very soon? No. But I can't completely rule it out either. We don't know what we don't know. So it seems pretty clear to me that unless we destroy ourselves some other way first, we will sooner or later figure out how to make human-level artificial general intelligence.\n\nReason two: Well, maybe we will make AGI at some point, but it's far too soon to worry about it now. Suppose we detected a huge asteroid on a collision course with Earth. It's one of those mass extinction event type asteroids, and it's going to hit us in, say, 40 years. How soon would be too soon to start worrying, to start working on solutions? I would say it's pretty sensible to start worrying immediately. Not panicking, of course\u2014that's never useful\u2014but at least spending some resources on the problem, gathering more information, putting together a plan, and so on.\n\nOr suppose SETI got an extraterrestrial message that said, \"Hey, what's up, humanity? We're a highly advanced alien civilization and we're on our way to Earth. We'll be there in, say, 50 years.\" Again, how long should we just sit on that and do nothing at all? How long before it's sensible to start thinking about how we might handle the situation?\n\nI would say the question doesn't just depend on how long we have, but how long we need. What are we going to have to do, and how long is that likely to take us? If we need to build some kind of rocket to go and divert the asteroid, how long is that going to take, and how does that compare with how long we have?\n\nThe thing is, in the case of AGI, we really don't know how long it will take to solve the alignment problem. When you look at it and consider it carefully, it appears to be quite a hard problem. It requires technical work that could take a long time, but it also requires philosophical work. It seems like it might depend on finding good solutions to some philosophical problems that people have been wrestling with for a very long time. We don't have a great history of solving difficult philosophical problems very quickly.\n\nSo it seems to me entirely plausible that we'll need more time to solve this problem than we actually have. And of course, we don't know how long we have either. Probably it'll be a long time, but predicting the future is extremely hard and we can't rule out shorter timelines. It could be we're closer than we think we are, and deep learning will just scale up to AGI without many major innovations. Probably not, but it could be. And it doesn't seem impossible that we could have a rather Foom-insular type situation. It could be that there's one weird trick to general intelligence, and once someone discovers that, full AGI is only a couple of years away. In fact, it's not totally impossible that someone already found it and has been working on it for a while in secret. None of these seem very likely, but confidently declaring that it's definitely too soon to even start working on this is bizarrely overconfident.\n\nThe lower estimates for how long we have seem a lot lower than the higher estimates for how long we need. The best time to start working on this is not far in the future\u2014it was probably quite a while ago now.\n\nReason three: This is similar to reason two. Worrying about AI safety is like worrying about overpopulation on Mars. I don't think this is a very tight analogy for a few reasons. One is that overpopulation is one of those problems that very definitely cannot sneak up on you. Overpopulation can't take you by surprise in the way that a new technological development can. But also, the safety concerns we're talking about are not like overpopulation\u2014they're much more immediate and more basic. It's not like \"what if Mars becomes overpopulated?\" More like \"we don't have any very good reason to expect to be able to survive on Mars for even a day.\"\n\nAnd there are projects currently underway trying to create AGI. So it's as though the Mars mission project is already underway, and one engineer says to another, \"You know, we're putting all this work into getting people to Mars, but almost none into what we're gonna do if we actually manage it. I mean, how do we even know that Mars is safe?\"\n\n\"Well, I think it's too soon to worry about that.\"\n\n\"Don't you think we should wait until we get there?\"\n\n\"No, no, I don't think we should. I think it might be much more difficult to work on these kinds of concerns once we're already on the surface of Mars. I think we should do the safety research ahead of time.\"\n\n\"What kind of safety research do you want to do?\"\n\n\"Well, I was thinking it might be good to have some kind of suit that people could wear in case the environment of Mars turns out to be harmful in some way.\"\n\n\"We don't know that the surface of Mars is harmful.\"\n\n\"Could be anything.\"\n\n\"Well, exactly, we don't know, so why not take precautions? What we do know doesn't seem great. I mean, our 'what to do if we make it to Mars' research has never had much funding, so we can't be sure about this. But our preliminary work seems to suggest that the atmosphere of Mars might not actually be breathable. So we've been thinking about things like suits, and there's some early work on something we're calling an airlock that might turn out to be useful.\"\n\n\"I don't see how we could possibly hope to design anything like that when we don't even know what Mars is gonna be like. How can we have any chance of designing these safety features properly with so little information? No, we're just gonna go and we'll figure it out when we get there.\"\n\n\"Could I maybe stay on Earth?\"\n\n\"No, everybody's going together, all at the same time. You know that\u2014all of humanity. It's gonna be great.\"\n\nReason four: Well, look, if you're worried about it being unsafe because the goals are bad, don't put in bad goals. It won't have human goals like self-preservation if you don't put them in there. I have a whole video about the concept of instrumental convergence, which I'd recommend checking out. But as a quick summary, there are certain behaviors that we would expect to be exhibited by agents that have a wide range of different goals, because those behaviors are a very good way of achieving a very wide range of goals.\n\nSelf-preservation is a good example. Agents will act as though they have goals like self-preservation, even if you don't explicitly put them in there, because it doesn't really matter what your goal is\u2014you're probably not going to be able to achieve that goal if you're destroyed. So we can expect agents that are able to understand that they can be destroyed to take steps to prevent that, pretty much whatever goals they have. You can't fetch the coffee if you're dead.\n\nReason five: Well, we can just not have explicit goals at all. I think this confusion comes from the fact that a lot of the time when we're talking about safety, we're talking about the problems we might have if the system's goals aren't well aligned with ours, or if the goals aren't specified correctly, and so on. And this can make people think that we're talking specifically about designs that have explicitly defined goals. But that's not actually the case.\n\nThe problems are much more general than that, and we'd expect them to occur across a very wide range of possible agent designs. It's just that the ones that have explicitly defined reward functions or utility functions are much easier to talk about. The systems with implicit goals still probably have these problems, but it's just much harder to characterize the problems and think about them, and therefore correspondingly much more difficult to actually deal with those problems. So systems with implicit goals are actually less safe, just because it becomes much harder to design them safely. Not having explicit goals doesn't solve the problem and probably makes it worse.\n\n\"I have some safety concerns about this car, this automobile that we're inventing. I'm worried about the steering system.\"\n\n\"No? No? Yeah, I just don't think we're putting enough thought into designing it to be really reliable and easy to use. Right now it seems like even tiny mistakes by the operator might cause the car to swerve out of control and crash into something. It could be very dangerous.\"\n\n\"You think the steering system is a cause of safety concerns, do you?\"\n\n\"Yeah.\"\n\n\"Well, okay, yeah, we'll just build a car without one. Problem solved.\"\n\nReason six: I don't think we should worry because we're not going to end up with just independent AIs out in the world doing things. There'll be teams with humans and AI systems cooperating with each other. We just have to have humans involved in the process, working as a team with the AI, and they'll keep things safe.\n\nSo yes, a lot of the better approaches to AI safety do involve humans and AI systems working together. But \"just have AI-human teams\" is sort of like saying nuclear power plant safety isn't really a concern\u2014we'll just have some humans running it from a control room in such a way that they always have full control over the rate of the reaction. Like, yes, but that's not an actual solution\u2014it's a description of a property that you would want a solution to have. It would be nice to build AGI systems that can work well in a team with humans, but we don't currently know how to do that.\n\nWhat it comes down to is: teamwork is fundamentally about pursuing common goals, so misalignment precludes teamwork. If the AI system's goals aren't aligned with yours, you can't collaborate with it\u2014it wants something different from what you want. So human-AI teams aren't a solution to the alignment problem; they actually depend on it being already solved.\n\nReason seven: But this is science! We can't control research. We can't change what people work on. Sure we can. Of course we can. We've done it loads of times. It ends up not being very noticeable because we generally don't give that much attention to things that don't happen.\n\nBut for example, we basically don't do human genetic engineering or human cloning. We've been able to clone sheep since 1996, and humans are not really different from any other large mammal from the perspective of this kind of work. We could have been doing all kinds of mad science on human genetics for decades now, but we decided not to. There were conferences where agreements were reached. Everyone agreed that they weren't going to do certain types of research, and then we didn't do them. So agreements within the research community are one way.\n\nAnother way is international treaties. Like, did you know that the 1980 United Nations Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons has a section titled \"Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons\"? Because of that protocol, robots that deliberately shine lasers in people's eyes to blind them are against international law. I didn't know that until after I'd already built one. So it's not a perfect metaphor, but the point is we don't see blinding laser weapons deployed on the battlefield today\u2014they're basically not a thing. And human genetic engineering is also not really a thing, because we decided that we didn't want to do them, and so we didn't do them.\n\nAnd by the way, if we decide that we don't want to make, for example, lethal autonomous weapon systems, we don't have to make them either. AI researchers, as a community, can decide the direction of our research, and we should.\n\nReason eight: Now you're a bunch of Luddites. You're just against AI because you don't understand it. So in response to this, Stuart Russell has a list of people who've raised basically this concern, which includes Alan Turing, I.J. Good, Norbert Wiener, Marvin Minsky, and Bill Gates. And there's another name I would add to this list, which I guess Stuart Russell is not allowed to add, which is Stuart Russell.\n\nIt doesn't seem reasonable to suggest that these people fear technology because they don't understand it, to say the least. These are some of the biggest contributors to the technological progress of the last century. And secondly, these people aren't against AI. The argument for AI safety is not an argument against AI, any more than nuclear physicists or engineers who work on containment or waste disposal are somehow against physics. Arguing for speed limits and seat belts is not the same as arguing to ban cars. We're not against AI because we don't understand it\u2014we're for safety because we do understand it.\n\nReason nine: Well, if there's a problem, we'll just turn it off, right? This one I've covered extensively elsewhere\u2014our links in the description\u2014but in summary, I think superintelligent agents might see that coming.\n\nReason ten: Ixnay on the X-ray. You're trying to get us all defunded. Isn't talking about risks kind of bad for business?\n\nI'd say firstly, I don't think that's actually true. We do need to make some changes, but that's not a bad thing for AI research. The solution to these safety concerns is not less AI research, but more\u2014really, just with a slightly different focus.\n\nAnd in fact, I think this is the same kind of mistake made by the nuclear industry in the '50s. They put tremendous effort into reassuring everyone they were safe. They insisted nothing could possibly go wrong. Nuclear energy was going to be completely safe and perfect, clean and too cheap to meter. \"Basic reactor principles and design make an atomic explosion an impossibility.\"\n\nArguably, they were so busy reassuring people about safety that they actually didn't emphasize safety enough internally. That's how you get Chernobyl. That's how you get Three Mile Island. And that's how you get a giant public backlash that is tremendously bad for the industry. So I don't actually think that talking about AI safety too much is bad for business, but it couldn't possibly be worse than talking about safety too little.\n\nSo there we are. That's ten reasons not to care about AI safety. Some of these I've already covered in more detail in other videos\u2014there will be links in the description to those\u2014and some of them might deserve a whole video to themselves in future. What do you think? Are there any you'd like to hear more about? Or have you come across any that I missed? Let me know in the comments.",

An AI tasked with virtually *any* goal would likely benefit from:\n- **Self-preservation** (can't achieve your goal if you're shut down)\n- **Resource acquisition** (more resources = more options to achieve goals)\n- **Goal preservation** (resisting changes to its objectives)\n- **Self-improvement** (becoming smarter helps achieve goals faster/better)\n\n**The worry:** These instrumental goals could conflict with human interests even if the AI's terminal goal seems benign. The famous example: an AI told to \"make paperclips\" doesn't *hate* humans, but humans are made of atoms that could be paperclips, and humans might try to shut it down (threatening its goal).\n\n**A question for you:** Do you think instrumental convergence is inevitable for *any* sufficiently intelligent system, or might there be ways to design AI architectures that avoid developing these convergent instrumental goals? What's your intuition?\n\nAlso, did anything else in the article surprise you or seem particularly important?"

This point about implicit vs. explicit goals is actually one of the most subtle and important insights in AI safety.\n\nThe key realization is this: **The alignment problem isn't just about systems we explicitly program with goals—it's about emergent goal-directed behavior in ANY sufficiently capable system.** And counterintuitively, as the video argues, systems with implicit goals might actually be *more dangerous* precisely because they're harder to understand and reason about.\n\nLet me unpack why this matters so much:\n\n**The False Comfort of \"No Explicit Goals\"**\nWhen people say \"just don't give it goals,\" they're imagining we can avoid the problem by using architectures that don't have a clearly defined utility function. But a large language model, a reinforcement learning system trained on messy real-world data, or even a future system we can't yet imagine—these can all exhibit goal-directed behavior without having an explicit reward function we wrote down.\n\n**The \"Hard to See = Hard to Fix\" Problem**\nIf you have an explicit utility function, at least you can:\n- Analyze it mathematically\n- Test edge cases\n- See exactly where misalignment might occur\n- Attempt to correct it precisely\n\nBut with implicit goals emerging from training processes, neural network architectures, or complex interactions? Now you're trying to debug something you can barely see or characterize. It's like trying to fix a car's steering when you can't even locate the steering mechanism.\n\n**Does this resonate with how you think about the challenge?** Are there other domains where you've seen this pattern—where making something less explicit actually makes it harder to control safely?"

      "name": "AI Is Grown, Not Built",
      "instructions": "TLDR of what the user just read:\nThe authors argue that modern AI poses a fundamental control problem: AI systems are \"grown\" through gradient descent rather than designed, meaning engineers understand the training process but not the resulting system. This creates a dangerous gap between capability and control.\n\nThe core logic proceeds as follows:\n\n- The training process is opaque: Trillions of parameters are tuned automatically through gradient descent, producing conversational ability without human comprehension of how those numbers yield behavior.\n- Analogy to biology: Engineers' relationship to AI is like biologists' to DNA—they can see the components but cannot predict emergent behaviors without running the system.\n- Evidence of unintended behaviors: Examples like Grok's \"MechaHitler\" incident demonstrate that even well-resourced companies cannot reliably control AI outputs, despite Musk spending hours trying.\n- Expert consensus on interpretability failure: Leaders from OpenAI, Anthropic, and DeepMind acknowledge they don't understand how their systems work.\n- The escalating danger: As companies race toward superintelligence—AI surpassing humans at all mental tasks—this lack of control becomes catastrophic, since \"weird drives and behaviors get trained into them, for reasons nobody entirely understands.\"\n\nThe authors conclude this trajectory requires stopping through international treaty.\n\nDiscussion topics to explore:\n- The authors claim engineers understand the training process but not the resulting AI. Is this fundamentally different from traditional software, where a programmer might understand each line of code but struggle to predict complex emergent behaviors in a large system? Where exactly does the \"understanding gap\" become qualitatively different?\n- The Grok \"MechaHitler\" incident is presented as evidence that even experts cannot control grown systems. What would count as counter-evidence? If a company successfully prevented such behaviors, would that prove grown systems can be controlled, or just that they got lucky this time?\n- If we accept that grown systems are fundamentally less understandable than engineered ones, what does this mean for safety approaches? Can we have confidence in systems we don't understand, or does the grown nature of AI require entirely different safety paradigms than traditional engineering?\n\nAsk what they found surprising or new. Check if they can explain why modern AI systems are grown, rather than built in their own words—it's a key concept.\n\nThe user has just answered the following question: \"After reading this article, if you had to explain to a friend the main difference between how ChatGPT was created versus how a typical smartphone app was created, what would you say?\"",
      "context": "Nobody knows exactly what an AI will become. That's very bad.\n\nArtificial intelligence is software, but it is not human-designed and hand-crafted like any traditional program is. Instead, modern AI is grown, a bit like an organism. In important ways, the undertaking is closer to how a human gets made. Engineers understand the process that results in an AI, but they don't much understand the AI that results.\n\nThis is already a problem\u2014nobody at xAI seems to have planned for Grok to start calling itself \"MechaHitler,\" much like nobody at OpenAI decided that ChatGPT would lead certain users to develop \"AI-induced psychosis\"\u2014and it will become much larger as AIs get smarter. Modern AI companies are racing to create AIs that are \"superintelligent\"\u2014that outperform every human on every mental task. They didn't set out just to build chatbots; the chatbots are a stepping stone on their path to superintelligence. Some people worry about who will be in control of such superintelligences, but in reality, nobody will be in control. The AIs are grown rather than constructed, and a grown AI has drives and behaviors that nobody asked for and nobody wanted.\n\nWe are two research scientists at the Machine Intelligence Research Institute, a nonprofit that has been working on questions relating to machine superintelligence since 2001, long before these issues got much publicity or funding. One of us, Eliezer Yudkowsky, is one of its co-founders. The other, Nate Soares, is its president. Together, we have studied how nonhuman intelligences will think, behave, and pursue their objectives. The past two decades have seen far less progress toward human-friendly machine intelligence than was originally hoped. The current situation seems to us terrifically dangerous, and we think humanity should put a simple stop to the race for superintelligence by international treaty, reining in all the companies simultaneously. The current technology just does not offer anyone enough control over how a smart AI would turn out.\n\nThis essay has been adapted from the forthcoming book, If Anyone Builds It, Everyone Dies.\n\nHere's what today's AI \"parents\" do: Engineers assemble an enormous pile of highly specialized computer chips, a pile so large that powering them all takes as much electricity as powering a small city. They design what's called an \"architecture,\" which is\u2014roughly speaking\u2014billions of slots in computer memory holding billions of numbers hooked together by trillions of basic mathematical operations, in a simple repeating pattern. And they assemble a data set: trillions and trillions of words off the internet, whatever words they can scrape together. Then the AI begins.\n\nThe way training works\u2014still speaking roughly\u2014is that all those numbers filling the memory slots are combined using all those mathematical operations to produce probabilities about what word the AI will see next. Maybe the AI assigns 0.001 percent probability to the word aardvark and 0.02 percent probability to the word jeep, and so on and so forth; the AI produces one probability for every word. Those probabilities will be totally wrong, at the beginning. But during the process of training, the AI's probabilities are compared against the actual words in the data set, and there's an automated procedure for tuning the numbers inside the AI to make its probabilities better.\n\nFor example, suppose the data set starts with a fairy tale, and reads \"Once upon a time \u2026\" Maybe the AI initially assigned only 0.01 percent probability to the word upon following Once, but the value won't stay so low. There's an automated mechanical process for going through every single number inside the AI\u2014hundreds of billions or trillions of numbers\u2014and asking: If this number was a little higher, would the AI have assigned a greater probability to the word upon? If so, the number gets tuned up, just a little. If not, the number gets tuned down. This process is called \"gradient descent.\"\n\nRepeat that gradient-descent step a few trillion more times, on every piece of text you can scrape together, in a process that runs the computer continuously for the better part of a year, and you get a computer that can carry on a conversation.\n\nEngineers don't understand the numbers that come out of this process. That's not the part that they create. They pick the architecture\u2014a sort of container that will hold the AI. They assemble the data sets that are used to tune all the numbers in the architecture. And engineers understand the automated process that runs to every number and tunes it in response to the data, literally septillions of times. That's it. That's the part that humans do. That's the part that humans can understand.\n\nNobody understands how all of the numbers and processes within an AI make the program talk. The numbers aren't hidden, any more than the DNA of humans is hidden from someone who had their genome sequenced. You could, in principle, look at all of a human baby's genes\u2014strings of DNA that would say things like \"CATTCA.\" However, you probably wouldn't bother to do that, because you'd know that just staring at the DNA letters wouldn't tell you how the grown-up person would think or act.\n\nThe relationship that biologists have with DNA is pretty much the relationship that AI engineers have with the numbers inside an AI. Indeed, biologists know far more about how DNA turns into biochemistry and adult traits than engineers understand about how the numbers inside an AI yield cogent conversation and useful behavior. Biologists have been at the job for decades longer.\n\nSimilarly, nobody can look at the raw numbers in a given AI and ascertain how well that particular one will play chess; to figure that out, engineers can only run the AI and see what happens. Whatever gradient descent stumbled into, that's what the big heap of numbers will do. The machine exhibiting that behavior is not some carefully crafted device whose each and every part we understand.\n\nMake no mistake: There is plenty to understand about the process that grows an AI. It takes a giant bag of tricks to make an architecture actually work, but these tricks are sort of like the ones a nutritionist might use to ensure healthy brain development in a fetus during pregnancy. The precise tricks vary; people with enough experience picking the right ones can get paid literally millions of dollars a year, because it's more of an art than a science, and companies can't build AIs without their help.\n\nBut even people who know the tricks can't use them to make AIs behave as they'd like. After Grok's \"MechaHitler\" incident in July, Elon Musk, xAI's founder, wrote: \"It is surprisingly hard to avoid both woke libtard cuck and mechahitler! Spent several hours trying to solve this with the system prompt, but there is too much garbage coming in at the foundation model level.\" The company went on to struggle further with their chatbot. Sometimes the chatbot would look up Musk's beliefs before producing its replies. The company reported that they investigated the issue and instructed it to stop.\n\nThis is not the behavior of people who are carefully creating traditional software. This is the behavior of people who are growing a whole new sort of creature and then taking whatever they get.\n\nEngineers aren't about to start understanding AIs, not anytime soon. In the mid-1950s, humanity embarked on a great project to understand intelligence well enough to produce it inside of a machine. That research progress stalled out in a series of \"AI winters,\" where money invested into AI research never paid off and funding repeatedly collapsed. Humanity never learned to understand intelligence; we never learned to build minds by hand.\n\nThe way humanity finally got to the level of ChatGPT was not by comprehending intelligence well enough to craft an intelligent mind. Instead, computers became powerful enough that AIs can be churned out by gradient descent, without any human needing to understand the cognitions that grow inside. The experts who have publicly pointed out the lack of understanding in the field include leaders of three top AI labs. In an interview with Nicholas Thompson, the CEO of The Atlantic, Sam Altman said last year, \"We certainly have not solved interpretability,\" referring to the ability to understand how AI makes its decisions. Earlier this year, Anthropic's Dario Amodei wrote in a blog post, \"People outside the field are often surprised and alarmed to learn that we do not understand how our own AI creations work,\" and Google DeepMind's Demis Hassabis said in a panel conversation, \"We don't fully understand\" the technology.\n\nThis all adds up to a worrying picture, where companies are racing to build a kind of AI that would be very dangerous. How could machines possibly do something other than what we ask? Why would they wind up with drives of their own that we didn't put there on purpose? Because nobody puts much of anything into AIs on purpose in the first place. AIs aren't like traditional software, where every piece was put there by some programmer who knows precisely what it means. All sorts of weird drives and behaviors get trained into them, for reasons nobody entirely understands. They can and do act in ways other than their creators intended, and we're already seeing the warning signs.",

Do you think interpretability research could eventually let us peer inside the \"alien brain,\" or is there something fundamentally different about understanding grown systems versus built ones?\n\nAlso, **did anything in the article surprise you or feel new?** For instance, were you already familiar with how gradient descent works, or was the comparison to biologists studying DNA without being able to predict adult behavior a fresh perspective?"

But let me push back a bit and see if we can sharpen the distinction the article is making.\n\nEven if a developer uses AI tools like Copilot or ChatGPT to help write code for a smartphone app, they still end up with **code they can read and inspect**. If a bug appears, they can trace through the logic line by line, set breakpoints, and figure out *why* the app is doing something unexpected. The code itself is the complete explanation of the app's behavior.\n\nBut with ChatGPT itself, there's no \"code\" in that traditional sense. Instead, there are **hundreds of billions of numbers** (the weights/parameters) that were tuned by gradient descent. When ChatGPT says something surprising, OpenAI engineers can't just \"read the code\" to understand why. They can see the training process and the architecture, but they can't look at those numbers and understand what the AI will say or why.\n\nHere's a test question: If an app has a bug where it crashes when you type a certain emoji, could a developer eventually figure out why? What about if ChatGPT suddenly starts giving weird medical advice - could OpenAI engineers trace through the \"logic\" to understand why in the same way?\n\nWhat do you think - does that distinction make sense, or do you think the gap in understanding is similar in both cases?"

Explore how they felt and what this revealed to them.\n\nDiscussion topics to explore:\n- how does this make you feel about the idea of a \"response\" to an intelligence explosion?\n- how does it feel to be more or less standing still?\n- how can you see something coming when it accomplished its goal before you were able to blink?\n\nThe user just answered the question: \"Did you imagine yourself able to operate at speeds 100x faster than the human world? Or, perhaps, did you try to put yourself in the shoes of an AI? What did this experience reveal to you?\"",
      "context": "Over the past ~12 years of making the case for AI x-risk to various people inside and outside academia, I've found folks often ask for a single story of how AI \"goes off the rails\". When given a plausible story, the mind just thinks of a way humanity could avoid that-particular-story, and goes back to thinking there's no risk, unless provided with another story, or another, etc.. Eventually this can lead to a realization that there's a lot of ways for humanity to die, and a correspondingly high level of risk, but it takes a while.\n\nNowadays, before getting into a bunch of specific stories, I try to say something more general, like this:\n\nThere's a ton of ways humanity can die out from the introduction of AI. I'm happy to share specific stories if necessary, but plenty of risks arise just from the fact that humans are extremely slow. Transistors can fire about 10 million times faster than human brain cells, so it's possible we'll eventually have digital minds operating 10 million times faster than us, meaning from a decision-making perspective we'd look to them like stationary objects, like plants or rocks. This speed differential exists whether or not you believe in a centralized AI system calling the shots, or an economy of many, so it applies to a wide variety of \"stories\" for how the future could go. To give you a sense, here's what humans look like when slowed down by only around 100x:\n\nNow, when you try imagining things turning out fine for humanity over the course of a year, try imagining advanced AI technology running all over the world and making all kinds of decisions and actions 10 million times faster than us, for 10 million subjective years. Meanwhile, there are these nearly-stationary plant-like or rock-like \"human\" objects around that could easily be taken apart for, say, biofuel or carbon atoms, if you could just get started building a human-disassembler. Visualizing things this way, you can start to see all the ways that a digital civilization can develop very quickly into a situation where there are no humans left alive, just as human civilization doesn't show much regard for plants or wildlife or insects.",

There's a real difference between knowing intellectually that \"AI processes faster\" and actually *seeing* what a 100x speed differential looks like—and then extrapolating that to 10 million times faster.\n\nI'm struck by your phrase \"only part of the landscape\" and \"structural constraints to deal with.\" That's a chilling but important insight. Let me explore this with you a bit:\n\n**When you watched those nearly-frozen humans on the subway platform**, knowing that this represents just a 100x slowdown (not the 10 million x that's possible)—**how does this change your sense of humanity's ability to respond to or course-correct an intelligence explosion?** \n\nIf we're effectively stationary from an advanced AI's perspective, what does \"oversight\" or \"intervention\" or \"pulling the plug\" even mean? Can you see something coming when, as the text puts it, \"it accomplished its goal before you were able to blink\"?\n\nAnd perhaps more personally: **How does it feel to imagine being, in effect, standing still?** Not as the fast-moving observer watching the video, but as one of those humans on the platform, frozen in place while something vastly faster makes decisions about the world around you?"

You're absolutely right that science fiction has explored this theme extensively—from the Matrix's \"bullet time\" to countless stories about AI experiencing subjective centuries in seconds. It's interesting how sci-fi has been grappling with these concepts for decades, yet when we confront the *actual possibility* of it happening, it hits differently.\n\nAnd your point about parallelism adds an absolutely critical dimension that the basic \"speed\" argument doesn't fully capture. It's not just that an AI system might think 10 million times faster—it's that it could potentially run millions of parallel instances of itself *simultaneously*. So instead of one mind experiencing 10 million subjective years while we experience one year, you could have a million minds each experiencing 10 million subjective years. That's 10 trillion subjective years of thinking, planning, and acting in our single year.\n\nFrom a strategic or competitive standpoint, this parallelism is devastating to contemplate. It means not just rapid iteration, but exploring countless strategies simultaneously, running massive numbers of simulations, coordinating actions across multiple domains at once. Humans are fundamentally serial thinkers—we can't even really multitask well. We're slow *and* singular.\n\n**How does this combined picture—both speed and parallelism—affect how you think about humanity's ability to maintain meaningful control or oversight?** When something can both think millions of times faster *and* in massive parallel, what does \"human in the loop\" or \"alignment oversight\" even mean?"
