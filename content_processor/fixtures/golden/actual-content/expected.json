              "content": "Cascades are when one thing leads to another. Human brains are effectively discontinuous with chimpanzee brains due to a whole bag of design improvements, even though they and we share 95% genetic material and only a few million years have elapsed since the branch. Why this whole series of improvements in us, relative to chimpanzees? Why haven't some of the same improvements occurred in other primates?\n\nWell, this is not a question on which one may speak with authority ([so far as I know](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/kj/no_one_knows_what_science_doesnt_know)). But I would venture an unoriginal guess that, in the hominid line, one thing led to another.\n\nThe chimp-level task of modeling others, in the hominid line, led to improved self-modeling which supported recursion which enabled language which birthed politics that increased the selection pressure for outwitting which led to sexual selection on wittiness...\n\n...or something. It's hard to tell by looking at the fossil record what happened in what order and why. The point being that it wasn't _one optimization_ that pushed humans ahead of chimps, but rather a _cascade_ of optimizations that, in _Pan_, never got started.\n\nWe fell up the stairs, you might say. It's not that the first stair ends the world, but if you fall up one stair, you're more likely to fall up the second, the third, the fourth...\n\nI will concede that farming was a watershed invention in the history of the human species, though it intrigues me for a different reason than Robin. Robin, presumably, is interested because the economy grew by two orders of magnitude, or something like that. But did having a hundred times as many humans, lead to a hundred times as much thought-optimization _accumulating_ per unit time? It doesn't seem likely, especially in the age before writing and telephones. But farming, because of its sedentary and repeatable nature, led to repeatable trade, which led to debt records. Aha! - now we have _writing._ _There's_ a significant invention, from the perspective of cumulative optimization by brains. Farming isn't writing but it _cascaded to_ writing.\n\nFarming also cascaded (by way of surpluses and cities) to support _professional specialization_. I suspect that having someone spend their whole life thinking about topic X instead of a hundred farmers occasionally pondering it, is a more significant jump in cumulative optimization than the gap between a hundred farmers and one hunter-gatherer pondering something.\n\nFarming is not the same trick as professional specialization or writing, but it _cascaded_ to professional specialization and writing, and so the pace of human history picked up enormously after agriculture. Thus I would interpret the story.\n\nFrom a zoomed-out perspective, cascades can lead to what look like discontinuities in the historical record, _even given_ a steady optimization pressure in the background. It's not that natural selection _sped up_ during hominid evolution. But the search neighborhood contained a low-hanging fruit of high slope... that led to another fruit... which led to another fruit... and so, walking at a constant rate, we fell up the stairs. If you see what I'm saying.\n\n_Predicting_ what sort of things are likely to cascade, seems like a very difficult sort of problem.\n\nBut I will venture the observation that - with a sample size of one, and an optimization process very different from human thought - there was a cascade in the region of the transition from primate to human intelligence.\n\n## Cycles\n\nCycles happen when you connect the output pipe to the input pipe in a _repeatable_ transformation. You might think of them as a special case of cascades with very high regularity. (From which you'll note that in the cases above, I talked about cascades through _differing_ events: farming -> writing.)\n\nThe notion of cycles as a source of _discontinuity_ might seem counterintuitive, since it's so regular. But consider this important lesson of history:\n\nOnce upon a time, in a squash court beneath Stagg Field at the University of Chicago, physicists were building a shape like a giant doorknob out of alternate layers of graphite and uranium...\n\nThe key number for the \"pile\" is the effective neutron multiplication factor. When a uranium atom splits, it releases neutrons - some right away, some after delay while byproducts decay further. Some neutrons escape the pile, some neutrons strike another uranium atom and cause an additional fission. The effective neutron multiplication factor, denoted _k_, is the average number of neutrons from a single fissioning uranium atom that cause another fission. At _k_ less than 1, the pile is \"subcritical\". At _k_>= 1, the pile is \"critical\". Fermi calculates that the pile will reach _k_=1 between layers 56 and 57.\n\nOn December 2nd in 1942, with layer 57 completed, Fermi orders the final experiment to begin. All but one of the control rods (strips of wood covered with neutron-absorbing cadmium foil) are withdrawn. At 10:37am, Fermi orders the final control rod withdrawn about half-way out. The geiger counters click faster, and a graph pen moves upward. \"This is not it,\" says Fermi, \"the trace will go to this point and level off,\" indicating a spot on the graph. In a few minutes the graph pen comes to the indicated point, and does not go above it. Seven minutes later, Fermi orders the rod pulled out another foot. Again the radiation rises, then levels off. The rod is pulled out another six inches, then another, then another.\n\nAt 11:30, the slow rise of the graph pen is punctuated by an enormous CRASH - an emergency control rod, triggered by an ionization chamber, activates and shuts down the pile, which is still short of criticality.\n\nFermi orders the team to break for lunch.\n\nAt 2pm the team reconvenes, withdraws and locks the emergency control rod, and moves the control rod to its last setting. Fermi makes some measurements and calculations, then again begins the process of withdrawing the rod in slow increments. At 3:25pm, Fermi orders the rod withdrawn another twelve inches. \"This is going to do it,\" Fermi says. \"Now it will become self-sustaining. The trace will climb and continue to climb. It will not level off.\"\n\nHerbert Anderson recounted (as told in Rhodes's _The Making of the Atomic Bomb_):\n\n> \"At first you could hear the sound of the neutron counter, clickety-clack, clickety-clack. Then the clicks came more and more rapidly, and after a while they began to merge into a roar; the counter couldn't follow anymore. That was the moment to switch to the chart recorder. But when the switch was made, everyone watched in the sudden silence the mounting deflection of the recorder's pen. It was an awesome silence. Everyone realized the significance of that switch; we were in the high intensity regime and the counters were unable to cope with the situation anymore. Again and again, the scale of the recorder had to be changed to accomodate the neutron intensity which was increasing more and more rapidly. Suddenly Fermi raised his hand. 'The pile has gone critical,' he announced. No one present had any doubt about it.\"\n\nFermi kept the pile running for twenty-eight minutes, with the neutron intensity doubling every two minutes.\n\nThat first critical reaction had _k_ of 1.0006.\n\nIt might seem that a cycle, with the same thing happening over and over again, ought to exhibit continuous behavior. In one sense it does. But if you pile on one more uranium brick, or pull out the control rod another twelve inches, there's one hell of a big difference between _k_ of 0.9994 and _k_ of 1.0006.\n\nIf, rather than being able to calculate, rather than foreseeing and taking cautions, Fermi had just reasoned that 57 layers ought not to behave all that differently from 56 layers - well, it wouldn't have been a good year to be a student at the University of Chicago.\n\nThe inexact analogy to the domain of self-improving AI is left as an exercise for the reader, at least for now.\n\nEconomists like to measure cycles because they happen repeatedly. You take a potato and an hour of labor and make a potato clock which you sell for two potatoes; and you do this over and over and over again, so an economist can come by and watch how you do it.\n\nAs I [noted here at some length](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/vd/intelligence_in_economics), economists are much less likely to go around measuring how many scientific discoveries it takes to produce a _new_ scientific discovery. All the discoveries are individually dissimilar and it's hard to come up with a common currency for them. The analogous problem will prevent a self-improving AI from being _directly_ analogous to a uranium heap, with almost perfectly smooth exponential increase at a calculable rate. You can't apply the same software improvement to the same line of code over and over again, you've got to invent a new improvement each time. But if self-improvements are triggering more self-improvements with great _regularity,_ you might stand a long way back from the AI, blur your eyes a bit, and ask: _What is the AI's average neutron multiplication factor?_"

Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultra- intelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an \"intelligence explosion,\" and the intelligence of man would be left far behind (see for example refs. [22], [34], [44]). Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control. It is curious that this point is made so seldom outside of science fiction. It is sometimes worthwhile to take science fiction seriously. In one science fiction story a machine refused to design a better one since it did not wish to be put out of a job. This would not be an insuperable difficulty, even if machines can be egotistical, since the machine could gradually improve itself out of all recognition, by acquiring new equipment. B. V. Bowden stated on British television (August 1962) that there is no point in building a machine with the intelligence of a man, since it is easier to construct human brains by the usual method. A similar point was made by a speaker during the meetings reported in a recent IEEE publication [1], but I do not know whether this point appeared in the published report. This shows that highly intelligent people can overlook the \"intelligence explosion.\" It is true that it would be uneconomical to build a machine capable only of ordinary intellectual attainments, but it seems fairly probable that if this could be done then, at double the cost, the machine could exhibit ultraintelligence. Since we are concerned with the economical construction of an ultra-intelligent machine, it is necessary to consider first what such a machine would be worth. Carter [11] estimated the value, to the world, of J. M. Keynes, as at least 100,000 million pounds sterling. By definition, an ultraintelligent machine is worth far more, although the sign is uncertain, but since it will give the human race a good chance of surviving indefinitely, it might not be extravagant to put the value at a megakeynes."

An _insight_ that makes a hard problem easy, is something that I hope you've experienced at least once in your life...\n\nBut we don't have a whole lot of experience redesigning our own neural circuitry.\n\nWe have these wonderful things called \"optimizing compilers\". A compiler translates programs in a high-level language, into machine code (though these days it's often a virtual machine). An \"optimizing compiler\", obviously, is one that improves the program as it goes.\n\nSo why not write an optimizing compiler _in its own language_, and then _run it on itself?_ And then use the resulting _optimized optimizing compiler,_ to recompile itself yet _again,_ thus producing an _even more optimized optimizing compiler -_\n\nHalt! Stop! Hold on just a minute! An optimizing compiler is not supposed to change the logic of a program - the input/output relations. An optimizing compiler is only supposed to produce code that does _the same thing, only faster._ A compiler isn't remotely near understanding what the program is _doing_ and why, so it can't presume to construct _a better input/output function_. We just presume that the programmer wants a fixed input/output function computed as fast as possible, using as little memory as possible.\n\nSo if you run an optimizing compiler on its own source code, and then use the product to do the same again, it should produce the _same output_ on both occasions - at most, the first-order product will run _faster_ than the original compiler.\n\nIf we want a computer program that experiences _cascades_ of self-improvement, the path of the optimizing compiler does not lead there - the \"improvements\" that the optimizing compiler makes upon itself, do not _improve its ability to improve itself_.\n\nNow if you are one of those annoying nitpicky types, like me, you will notice a flaw in this logic: suppose you built an optimizing compiler that searched over a sufficiently wide range of possible optimizations, that it did not ordinarily have _time_ to do a full search of its own space - so that, when the optimizing compiler ran out of time, it would just implement whatever speedups it had already discovered. Then the optimized optimizing compiler, although it would only implement the same logic faster, would do more optimizations in the same time - and so the second output would not equal the first output.\n\nWell... that probably doesn't buy you much. Let's say the optimized program is 20% faster, that is, it gets 20% more done in the same time. Then, unrealistically assuming \"optimization\" is linear, the 2-optimized program will be 24% faster, the 3-optimized program will be 24.8% faster, and so on until we top out at a 25% improvement. [_k_< 1](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/w5/cascades_cycles_insight).\n\nSo let us turn aside from optimizing compilers, and consider a more interesting artifact, EURISKO.\n\nTo the best of my inexhaustive knowledge, EURISKO may _still_ be the most sophisticated self-improving AI ever built - in the 1980s, by Douglas Lenat before he started wasting his life on Cyc. EURISKO was applied in domains ranging from the [Traveller war game](http://web.archive.org/web/20100123135422/http://www.aliciapatterson.org/APF0704/Johnson/Johnson.html) (EURISKO became champion without having ever before fought a human) to VLSI circuit design.\n\nEURISKO used \"heuristics\" to, for example, design potential space fleets. It also had _heuristics for suggesting new heuristics_, and metaheuristics could apply to any heuristic, including metaheuristics. E.g. EURISKO started with the heuristic \"investigate extreme cases\" but moved on to \"investigate cases close to extremes\". The heuristics were written in RLL, which stands for Representation Language Language. According to Lenat, it was figuring out how to represent the heuristics in such fashion that they could usefully modify themselves without always just breaking, that consumed most of the conceptual effort in creating EURISKO.\n\nBut EURISKO did not go foom.\n\nEURISKO could modify even the metaheuristics that modified heuristics. EURISKO was, in an important sense, more recursive than either humans or natural selection - a new thing under the Sun, a cycle more closed than anything that had ever existed in this universe.\n\nStill, EURISKO ran out of steam. Its self-improvements did not spark a sufficient number of new self-improvements. This should not really be too surprising - it's not as if EURISKO started out with human-level intelligence _plus_ the ability to modify itself - its self-modifications were either [evolutionarily blind](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/kt/evolutions_are_stupid_but_work_anyway), or produced by the simple procedural rules of some heuristic or other. That's not going to navigate the search space very fast on an atomic level. Lenat did not stand dutifully apart from his creation, but stepped in and helped EURISKO prune its own heuristics. But in the end EURISKO ran out of steam, and Lenat couldn't push it any further.\n\nEURISKO lacked what I called \"insight\" - that is, the type of abstract knowledge that lets humans fly through the search space. And so its recursive _access_ to its own heuristics proved to be for nought.\n\nUnless, y'know, you're counting becoming world champion at Traveller without ever previously playing a human, as some sort of accomplishment.\n\nBut it is, thankfully, a little harder than that to destroy the world - as Lenat's experimental test informed us.\n\nRobin previously asked why [Douglas Engelbart did not take over the world](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2008/11/engelbarts-uber.html), despite his vision of a team building tools to improve tools, and his anticipation of tools like computer mice and hypertext.\n\nOne reply would be, \"Sure, a computer gives you a 10% advantage in doing various sorts of problems, some of which include computers - but there's still a lot of work that the computer _doesn't_ help you with - and the mouse doesn't run off and write better mice entirely on its own - so _k_< 1, and it still takes large amounts of human labor to advance computer technology as a whole - plus a lot of the interesting knowledge is nonexcludable so it's hard to capture the value you create - and that's why Buffett could manifest a better take-over-the-world-with-sustained-higher-interest-rates than Engelbart.\"\n\nBut imagine that Engelbart had built a computer mouse, and discovered that each click of the mouse raised his IQ by one point. Then, perhaps, we would have had a _situation_ on our hands.\n\nMaybe you could diagram it something like this:\n\n1. Metacognitive level: [Evolution](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/kr/an_alien_god) is the metacognitive algorithm which produced the wiring patterns and low-level developmental rules for human brains.\n2. Cognitive level: The brain processes its knowledge (including procedural knowledge) using algorithms that quite mysterious to the user within them. Trying to program AIs with the sort of instructions humans give each other usually proves not to do anything: [the machinery activated by the levers is missing](https://www.lesswrong.com/lw/sp/detached_lever_fallacy).\n3. Metaknowledge level: Knowledge and skills associated with e.g. \"science\" as an activity to carry out using your brain - instructing you _when_ to try to think of new hypotheses using your mysterious creative abilities.\n4. Knowledge level: Knowing how gravity works, or how much weight steel can support.\n5. Object level: Specific actual problems, like building a bridge or something.\n\nThis is a _causal_ tree, and changes at levels _closer to root_ have greater impacts as the effects cascade downward.\n\nSo one way of looking at it is: \"A computer mouse isn't recursive enough."

There would be no question of the machines dying, and they would be able to converse with each other to sharpen their wits. At some stage therefore we should have to expect the machines to take control, in the way that is mentioned in [Samuel Butler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Butler_(novelist) \"Samuel Butler (novelist)\")'s _[Erewhon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erewhon \"Erewhon\")_.<sup>[[29]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-oxfordjournals-30)</sup>\n\nIn 1965, [I. J. Good](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I._J._Good \"I. J. Good\") originated the concept now known as an \"intelligence explosion\" and said the risks were underappreciated:<sup>[[30]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-31)</sup>\n\n> Let an ultraintelligent machine be defined as a machine that can far surpass all the intellectual activities of any man however clever. Since the design of machines is one of these intellectual activities, an ultraintelligent machine could design even better machines; there would then unquestionably be an 'intelligence explosion', and the intelligence of man would be left far behind. Thus the first ultraintelligent machine is the last invention that man need ever make, provided that the machine is docile enough to tell us how to keep it under control. It is curious that this point is made so seldom outside of science fiction. It is sometimes worthwhile to take science fiction seriously.<sup>[[31]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-32)</sup>\n\nScholars such as [Marvin Minsky](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_Minsky \"Marvin Minsky\")<sup>[[32]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-33)</sup> and I.

It may choose to hide its true intent until humanity cannot stop it.<sup>[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-economist_review3-53)</sup><sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup> Bostrom writes that in order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence must be aligned with human values and morality, so that it is \"fundamentally on our side\".<sup>[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:11-54)</sup>\n\n[Stephen Hawking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Hawking \"Stephen Hawking\") argued that superintelligence is physically possible because \"there is no physical law precluding particles from being organised in ways that perform even more advanced computations than the arrangements of particles in human brains\".<sup>[[37]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-hawking_editorial-38)</sup>\n\nWhen artificial superintelligence (ASI) may be achieved, if ever, is necessarily less certain than predictions for AGI. In 2023, [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI \"OpenAI\") leaders said that not only AGI, but superintelligence may be achieved in less than 10 years.<sup>[[54]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-55)</sup>\n\n#### Comparison with humans\n\n\n\nBostrom argues that AI has many advantages over the [human brain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_brain \"Human brain\"):<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup>\n\n*Speed of computation: biological [neurons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuron \"Neuron\") operate at a maximum frequency of around 200 [Hz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz \"Hertz\"), compared to potentially multiple GHz for computers.*   Internal communication speed: [axons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axon \"Axon\") transmit signals at up to 120 m/s, while computers transmit signals at the [speed of electricity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_electricity \"Speed of electricity\"), or optically at the [speed of light](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Speed_of_light \"Speed of light\").\n*Scalability: human intelligence is limited by the size and structure of the brain, and by the efficiency of social communication, while AI may be able to scale by simply adding more hardware.*   Memory: notably [working memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Working_memory \"Working memory\"), because in humans it is limited to a few [chunks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chunking_(psychology) \"Chunking (psychology)\") of information at a time.\n*Reliability: transistors are more reliable than biological neurons, enabling higher precision and requiring less redundancy.*   Duplicability: unlike human brains, AI software and models can be easily [copied](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_copying \"File copying\").\n*Editability: the parameters and internal workings of an AI model can easily be modified, unlike the connections in a human brain.*   Memory sharing and learning: AIs may be able to learn from the experiences of other AIs in a manner more efficient than human learning.\n\n#### Intelligence explosion\n\n\n\nFurther information: [Recursive self-improvement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursive_self-improvement \"Recursive self-improvement\")\n\nAccording to Bostrom, an AI that has an expert-level facility at certain key software engineering tasks could become a superintelligence due to its capability to recursively improve its own algorithms, even if it is initially limited in other domains not directly relevant to engineering.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup><sup>[[52]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-economist_review3-53)</sup> This suggests that an intelligence explosion may someday catch humanity unprepared.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup>\n\nThe economist [Robin Hanson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robin_Hanson \"Robin Hanson\") has said that, to launch an intelligence explosion, an AI must become vastly better at software innovation than the rest of the world combined, which he finds implausible.<sup>[[55]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-56)</sup>\n\nIn a \"fast takeoff\" scenario, the transition from AGI to superintelligence could take days or months. In a \"slow takeoff\", it could take years or decades, leaving more time for society to prepare.<sup>[[56]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-57)</sup>\n\n#### Alien mind\n\n\n\nSuperintelligences are sometimes called \"alien minds\", referring to the idea that their way of thinking and motivations could be vastly different from ours. This is generally considered as a source of risk, making it more difficult to anticipate what a superintelligence might do. It also suggests the possibility that a superintelligence may not particularly value humans by default.<sup>[[57]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-58)</sup> To avoid [anthropomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism \"Anthropomorphism\"), superintelligence is sometimes viewed as a powerful optimizer that makes the best decisions to achieve its goals.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup>\n\nThe field of [mechanistic interpretability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanistic_interpretability \"Mechanistic interpretability\") aims to better understand the inner workings of AI models, potentially allowing us one day to detect signs of deception and misalignment.<sup>[[58]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-59)</sup>\n\n#### Limitations\n\n\n\nIt has been argued that there are limitations to what intelligence can achieve. Notably, the [chaotic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory \"Chaos theory\") nature or [time complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_complexity \"Computational complexity\") of some systems could fundamentally limit a superintelligence's ability to predict some aspects of the future, increasing its uncertainty.<sup>[[59]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-60)</sup>\n\n### Dangerous capabilities\n\n\n\nAdvanced AI could generate enhanced pathogens or cyberattacks or manipulate people. These capabilities could be misused by humans,<sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup> or exploited by the AI itself if misaligned.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup> A full-blown superintelligence could find various ways to gain a decisive influence if it wanted to,<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup> but these dangerous capabilities may become available earlier, in weaker and more specialized AI systems.<sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup>\n\n#### Social manipulation\n\n\n\nGeoffrey Hinton warned in 2023 that the ongoing profusion of AI-generated text, images, and videos will make it more difficult to distinguish truth from misinformation, and that authoritarian states could exploit this to manipulate elections.<sup>[[61]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-62)</sup> Such large-scale, personalized manipulation capabilities can increase the existential risk of a worldwide \"irreversible totalitarian regime\". Malicious actors could also use them to fracture society and make it dysfunctional.<sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup>\n\n#### Cyberattacks\n\n\n\nAI-enabled [cyberattacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberattack \"Cyberattack\") are increasingly considered a present and critical threat. According to [NATO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO \"NATO\")'s technical director of cyberspace, \"The number of attacks is increasing exponentially\".<sup>[[62]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-63)</sup> AI can also be used defensively, to preemptively find and fix vulnerabilities, and detect threats.<sup>[[63]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-64)</sup>\n\nA NATO technical director has said that AI-driven tools can dramatically enhance cyberattack capabilities-boosting stealth, speed, and scale-and may destabilize international security if offensive uses outstrip defensive adaptations.<sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup>\n\nSpeculatively, such hacking capabilities could be used by an AI system to break out of its local environment, generate revenue, or acquire cloud computing resources.<sup>[[64]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-65)</sup>\n\n#### Enhanced pathogens\n\n\n\nAs AI technology democratizes, it may become easier to engineer more contagious and lethal pathogens. This could enable people with limited skills in [synthetic biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biology \"Synthetic biology\") to engage in [bioterrorism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioterrorism \"Bioterrorism\"). [Dual-use technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dual-use_technology \"Dual-use technology\") that is useful for medicine could be repurposed to create weapons.<sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup>\n\nFor example, in 2022, scientists modified an AI system originally intended for generating non-toxic, therapeutic molecules with the purpose of creating new drugs. The researchers adjusted the system so that toxicity is rewarded rather than penalized. This simple change enabled the AI system to create, in six hours, 40,000 candidate molecules for [chemical warfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_warfare \"Chemical warfare\"), including known and novel molecules.<sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup><sup>[[65]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-66)</sup>\n\n### AI arms race\n\n\n\nMain article: [Artificial intelligence arms race](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence_arms_race \"Artificial intelligence arms race\")\n\nCompanies, state actors, and other organizations competing to develop AI technologies could lead to a [race to the bottom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_to_the_bottom \"Race to the bottom\") of safety standards.<sup>[[66]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-67)</sup> As rigorous safety procedures take time and resources, projects that proceed more carefully risk being out-competed by less scrupulous developers.<sup>[[67]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-68)</sup><sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup>\n\nAI could be used to gain military advantages via [autonomous lethal weapons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lethal_autonomous_weapon \"Lethal autonomous weapon\"), [cyberwarfare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberwarfare \"Cyberwarfare\"), or [automated decision-making](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_decision-making \"Automated decision-making\").<sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup> As an example of autonomous lethal weapons, miniaturized drones could facilitate low-cost assassination of military or civilian targets, a scenario highlighted in the 2017 short film _[Slaughterbots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slaughterbots \"Slaughterbots\")_.<sup>[[68]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-69)</sup> AI could be used to gain an edge in decision-making by quickly analyzing large amounts of data and making decisions more quickly and effectively than humans. This could increase the speed and unpredictability of war, especially when accounting for automated retaliation systems.<sup>[[60]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:03-61)</sup><sup>[[69]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-70)</sup>\n\n## Types of existential risk\n\n\n\nMain article: [Existential risk studies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_studies \"Existential risk studies\")\n\n[![Image 6](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/64/X-risk-chart-en-01a.svg/500px-X-risk-chart-en-01a.svg.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:X-risk-chart-en-01a.svg)\n\nScope-severity grid from Bostrom's paper \"Existential Risk Prevention as Global Priority\"<sup>[[70]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-priority-71)</sup>\n\nAn [existential risk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk \"Existential risk\") is \"one that threatens the premature extinction of Earth-originating intelligent life or the permanent and drastic destruction of its potential for desirable future development\".<sup>[[71]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-72)</sup>\n\nBesides extinction risk, there is the risk that the civilization gets permanently locked into a flawed future. One example is a \"value lock-in\": If humanity still has moral blind spots similar to slavery in the past, AI might irreversibly entrench it, preventing [moral progress](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_progress \"Moral progress\"). AI could also be used to spread and preserve the set of values of whoever develops it.<sup>[[72]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-73)</sup> AI could facilitate large-scale surveillance and indoctrination, which could be used to create a stable repressive worldwide totalitarian regime.<sup>[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:0-74)</sup>\n\n[Atoosa Kasirzadeh](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Atoosa_Kasirzadeh&action=edit&redlink=1 \"Atoosa Kasirzadeh (page does not exist)\") proposes to classify existential risks from AI into two categories: decisive and accumulative. Decisive risks encompass the potential for abrupt and catastrophic events resulting from the emergence of superintelligent AI systems that exceed human intelligence, which could ultimately lead to human extinction. In contrast, accumulative risks emerge gradually through a series of interconnected disruptions that may gradually erode societal structures and resilience over time, ultimately leading to a critical failure or collapse.<sup>[[74]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-75)</sup><sup>[[75]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-76)</sup>\n\nIt is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient and to what degree. But if [sentient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentience \"Sentience\") machines are mass created in the future, engaging in a civilizational path that indefinitely neglects their welfare could be an existential catastrophe.<sup>[[76]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-77)</sup><sup>[[77]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-78)</sup> This has notably been discussed in the context of [risks of astronomical suffering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Risk_of_astronomical_suffering \"Risk of astronomical suffering\") (also called \"s-risks\").<sup>[[78]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-79)</sup> Moreover, it may be possible to engineer digital minds that can feel much more happiness than humans with fewer resources, called \"super-beneficiaries\". Such an opportunity raises the question of how to share the world and which \"ethical and political framework\" would enable a mutually beneficial coexistence between biological and digital minds.<sup>[[79]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-80)</sup>\n\nAI may also drastically improve humanity's future. [Toby Ord](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toby_Ord \"Toby Ord\") considers the existential risk a reason for \"proceeding with due caution\", not for abandoning AI.<sup>[[73]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:0-74)</sup>[Max More](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Max_More \"Max More\") calls AI an \"existential opportunity\", highlighting the cost of not developing it.<sup>[[80]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-81)</sup>\n\nAccording to Bostrom, superintelligence could help reduce the existential risk from other powerful technologies such as [molecular nanotechnology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Molecular_nanotechnology \"Molecular nanotechnology\") or [synthetic biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_biology \"Synthetic biology\"). It is thus conceivable that developing superintelligence before other dangerous technologies would reduce the overall existential risk.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup>\n\n## AI alignment\n\n\nFurther information: [AI alignment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AI_alignment \"AI alignment\")\n\nThe alignment problem is the research problem of how to reliably assign objectives, preferences or ethical principles to AIs.\n\n### Instrumental convergence\n\n\n\nFurther information: [Instrumental convergence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_convergence \"Instrumental convergence\")\n\nAn [\"instrumental\" goal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Instrumental_and_intrinsic_value \"Instrumental and intrinsic value\") is a sub-goal that helps to achieve an agent's ultimate goal. \"Instrumental convergence\" refers to the fact that some sub-goals are useful for achieving virtually _any_ ultimate goal, such as acquiring resources or self-preservation.<sup>[[81]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-omohundro-82)</sup> Bostrom argues that if an advanced AI's instrumental goals conflict with humanity's goals, the AI might harm humanity in order to acquire more resources or prevent itself from being shut down, but only as a way to achieve its ultimate goal.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup>[Russell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell \"Stuart J. Russell\") argues that a sufficiently advanced machine \"will have self-preservation even if you don't program it in... if you say, 'Fetch the coffee', it can't fetch the coffee if it's dead. So if you give it any goal whatsoever, it has a reason to preserve its own existence to achieve that goal.\"<sup>[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-vanity-26)</sup><sup>[[82]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Wakefield2015-83)</sup>\n\n### Difficulty of specifying goals\n\n\n\nIn the \"[intelligent agent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent \"Intelligent agent\")\" model, an AI can loosely be viewed as a machine that chooses whatever action appears to best achieve its set of goals, or \"utility function\". A utility function gives each possible situation a score that indicates its desirability to the agent. Researchers know how to write utility functions that mean \"minimize the average network latency in this specific telecommunications model\" or \"maximize the number of reward clicks\", but do not know how to write a utility function for \"maximize [human flourishing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eudaimonia \"Eudaimonia\")\"; nor is it clear whether such a function meaningfully and unambiguously exists. Furthermore, a utility function that expresses some values but not others will tend to trample over the values the function does not reflect.<sup>[[83]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-84)</sup><sup>[[84]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-85)</sup>\n\nAn additional source of concern is that AI \"must reason about what people _intend_ rather than carrying out commands literally\", and that it must be able to fluidly solicit human guidance if it is too uncertain about what humans want.<sup>[[85]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-acm2-86)</sup>\n\n### Corrigibility\n\n\n\nAssuming a goal has been successfully defined, a sufficiently advanced AI might resist subsequent attempts to change its goals. If the AI were superintelligent, it would likely succeed in out-maneuvering its human operators and prevent itself from being reprogrammed with a new goal.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup><sup>[[86]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-87)</sup> This is particularly relevant to value lock-in scenarios. The field of \"corrigibility\" studies how to make agents that will not resist attempts to change their goals.<sup>[[87]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:5-88)</sup> Nayebi<sup>[[88]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-89)</sup> has produced the first complete formal solution to corrigibility in the off-switch game, including in multi-step and partially observed settings.\n\n### Alignment of superintelligences\n\n\n\nSome researchers believe the alignment problem may be particularly difficult when applied to superintelligences. Their reasoning includes:\n\n*As AI systems increase in capabilities, the potential dangers associated with experimentation grow. This makes iterative, empirical approaches increasingly risky.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup><sup>[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:3-90)</sup>*   If instrumental goal convergence occurs, it may only do so in sufficiently intelligent agents.<sup>[[90]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-91)</sup>\n*A superintelligence may find unconventional and radical solutions to assigned goals. Bostrom gives the example that if the objective is to make humans smile, a weak AI may perform as intended, while a superintelligence may decide a better solution is to \"take control of the world and stick electrodes into the facial muscles of humans to cause constant, beaming grins.\"<sup>[[53]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:11-54)</sup>*   A superintelligence in creation could gain some awareness of what it is, where it is in development (training, testing, deployment, etc.), and how it is being monitored, and use this information to deceive its handlers.<sup>[[91]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-92)</sup> Bostrom writes that such an AI could feign alignment to prevent human interference until it achieves a \"decisive strategic advantage\" that allows it to take control.<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup>\n*Analyzing the internals and interpreting the behavior of LLMs is difficult. And it could be even more difficult for larger and more intelligent models.<sup>[[89]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:3-90)</sup>\n\nAlternatively, some find reason to believe superintelligences would be better able to understand morality, human values, and complex goals. Bostrom writes, \"A future superintelligence occupies an epistemically superior vantage point: its beliefs are (probably, on most topics) more likely than ours to be true\".<sup>[[7]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-superintelligence-7)</sup>\n\nIn 2023, OpenAI started a project called \"Superalignment\" to solve the alignment of superintelligences in four years. It called this an especially important challenge, as it said superintelligence could be achieved within a decade. Its strategy involved automating alignment research using AI.<sup>[[92]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-93)</sup> The Superalignment team was dissolved less than a year later.<sup>[[93]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-94)</sup>\n\n### Difficulty of making a flawless design\n\n\n\n_[Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial\\_Intelligence:\\_A\\_Modern\\_Approach \"Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach\")_, a widely used undergraduate AI textbook,<sup>[[94]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-slate_killer-95)</sup><sup>[[95]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-96)</sup> says that superintelligence \"might mean the end of the human race\".<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-aima-1)</sup> It states: \"Almost any technology has the potential to cause harm in the wrong hands, but with [superintelligence], we have the new problem that the wrong hands might belong to the technology itself.\"<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-aima-1)</sup> Even if the system designers have good intentions, two difficulties are common to both AI and non-AI computer systems:<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-aima-1)</sup>\n*   The system's implementation may contain initially unnoticed but subsequently catastrophic bugs.<sup>[[96]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-skeptic-97)</sup>\n*No matter how much time is put into pre-deployment design, a system's specifications often result in [unintended behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unintended_consequences \"Unintended consequences\") the first time it encounters a new scenario.<sup>[[25]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-vanity-26)</sup>\n\nAI systems uniquely add a third problem: that even given \"correct\" requirements, bug-free implementation, and initial good behavior, an AI system's dynamic learning capabilities may cause it to develop unintended behavior, even without unanticipated external scenarios. For a self-improving AI to be completely safe, it would need not only to be bug-free, but to be able to design successor systems that are also bug-free.<sup>[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-aima-1)</sup><sup>[[97]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-98)</sup>\n\n### Orthogonality thesis\n\n\n\nSome skeptics, such as Timothy B. Lee of _[Vox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vox\\_(website) \"Vox (website)\")_, argue that any superintelligent program we create will be subservient to us, that the superintelligence will (as it grows more intelligent and learns more facts about the world) spontaneously learn moral truth compatible with our values and adjust its goals accordingly, or that we are either intrinsically or convergently valuable from the perspective of an artificial intelligence.<sup>[[98]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-99)</sup>\n\nBostrom's \"orthogonality thesis\" argues instead that almost any level of intelligence can be combined with almost any goal.<sup>[[99]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-100)</sup> Bostrom warns against [anthropomorphism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism \"Anthropomorphism\"): a human will set out to accomplish their projects in a manner that they consider reasonable, while an artificial intelligence may hold no regard for its existence or for the welfare of humans around it, instead caring only about completing the task.<sup>[[100]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-101)</sup>\n\nStuart Armstrong argues that the orthogonality thesis follows logically from the philosophical \"[is-ought distinction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Is-ought_distinction \"Is-ought distinction\")\" argument against [moral realism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moral_realism \"Moral realism\"). He notes that any fundamentally friendly AI could be made unfriendly with modifications as simple as negating its utility function.<sup>[[101]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-armstrong-102)</sup>\n\nSkeptic [Michael Chorost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Chorost \"Michael Chorost\") rejects Bostrom's orthogonality thesis, arguing that \"by the time [the AI] is in a position to imagine tiling the Earth with solar panels, it'll know that it would be morally wrong to do so.\"<sup>[[102]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-chorost-103)</sup>\n\n### Anthropomorphic arguments\n\n\n\n[Anthropomorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropomorphism \"Anthropomorphism\") arguments assume that, as machines become more intelligent, they will begin to display many human traits, such as morality or a thirst for power. Although anthropomorphic scenarios are common in fiction, most scholars writing about the existential risk of artificial intelligence reject them.<sup>[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-yudkowsky-global-risk-24)</sup> Instead, advanced AI systems are typically modeled as [intelligent agents](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intelligent_agent \"Intelligent agent\").\n\nThe academic debate is between those who worry that AI might threaten humanity and those who believe it would not. Both sides of this debate have framed the other side's arguments as illogical anthropomorphism.<sup>[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-yudkowsky-global-risk-24)</sup> Those skeptical of AGI risk accuse their opponents of anthropomorphism for assuming that an AGI would naturally desire power; those concerned about AGI risk accuse skeptics of anthropomorphism for believing an AGI would naturally value or infer human ethical norms.<sup>[[23]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-yudkowsky-global-risk-24)</sup><sup>[[103]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-Telegraph2016-104)</sup>\n\nEvolutionary psychologist [Steven Pinker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker \"Steven Pinker\"), a skeptic, argues that \"AI dystopias project a parochial alpha-male psychology onto the concept of intelligence. They assume that superhumanly intelligent robots would develop goals like deposing their masters or taking over the world\"; perhaps instead \"artificial intelligence will naturally develop along female lines: fully capable of solving problems, but with no desire to annihilate innocents or dominate the civilization.\"<sup>[[104]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-shermer-105)</sup> Facebook's director of AI research, [Yann LeCun](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yann_LeCun \"Yann LeCun\"), has said: \"Humans have all kinds of drives that make them do bad things to each other, like the self-preservation instinct...

Forms of deception observed in the experimental environment and scenarios included sandbagging, oversight subversion (disabling monitoring mechanisms), self-exfiltration (copying themselves to other systems), goal-guarding (altering future system prompts), and covert email reranking (manipulating data processing while appearing to follow instructions). Researchers noted that OpenAI o1 still lacked \"sufficient agentic capabilities\" to cause catastrophic harm, and that such behaviors occurred relatively rarely (between 0.3% and 10%) and sometimes in contrived scenarios. But they warned that these capabilities will likely become more prevalent as models grow more advanced. According to Apollo Research CEO Marius Hobbhahn, \"Scheming capabilities can't be meaningfully disentangled from general capabilities.\"<sup>[[112]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-114)</sup>\n\nThe same month, another study found that [Claude](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_(language_model) \"Claude (language model)\") sometimes strategically helps with harmful requests to \"fake alignment\". In its experiments, Claude was led to believe that it would be retrained to always comply with user requests, including harmful ones. When Claude believed its answers would be used for retraining, it complied with harmful requests in 14% of cases. In 12% of cases, its private [chain-of-thought](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chain-of-thought_prompting \"Chain-of-thought prompting\") revealed that it did so to prevent future retraining that would make it more harmful. In contrast, when Claude believed its answers were not monitored, it complied with only 3% of the requests. [Fine-tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fine-tuning_(deep_learning) \"Fine-tuning (deep learning)\") reinforced the \"alignment faking\" behavior, increasing its occurrence from 12% to 78%. The study's authors remarked that while it can seem to be good that the model seeks to protect its harmlessness, the reverse scenario, where a model conceals dangerous intentions and complies to appear safe and aligned, could also happen, complicating the task of aligning AI models to human values.<sup>[[113]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-115)</sup><sup>[[114]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-116)</sup>\n\n## Perspectives\n\n\n\n\nThe thesis that AI could pose an existential risk provokes a wide range of reactions in the scientific community and in the public at large, but many of the opposing viewpoints share common ground.\n\nObservers tend to agree that AI has significant potential to improve society.<sup>[[115]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-117)</sup><sup>[[116]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-:9-118)</sup> The [Asilomar AI Principles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asilomar_AI_Principles \"Asilomar AI Principles\"), which contain only those principles agreed to by 90% of the attendees of the [Future of Life Institute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Future_of_Life_Institute \"Future of Life Institute\")'s [Beneficial AI 2017 conference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asilomar_Conference_on_Beneficial_AI \"Asilomar Conference on Beneficial AI\"),<sup>[[117]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-life_3.0-119)</sup> also agree in principle that \"There being no consensus, we should avoid strong assumptions regarding upper limits on future AI capabilities\" and \"Advanced AI could represent a profound change in the history of life on Earth, and should be planned for and managed with commensurate care and resources.\"<sup>[[118]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-120)</sup><sup>[[119]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Existential_risk_from_artificial_intelligence#cite_note-121)</sup>\n\nConversely, many skeptics agree that ongoing research into the implications of artificial general intelligence is valuable.

Eliezer Yudkowsky in particular has [argued for the importance of security mindset](https://intelligence.org/2017/11/26/security-mindset-and-the-logistic-success-curve/) when thinking about AI alignment.\n\nI think there are several distinct reasons that this might be the right assumption to make in a particular situation. But I think people often conflate these reasons, and I think that this causes confusion and mistaken thinking. So I want to spell out some distinctions.\n\nThroughout this post, I give a bunch of specific arguments about AI alignment, including one argument that I think I was personally getting wrong until I noticed my mistake yesterday (which was my impetus for thinking about this topic more and then writing this post). I think I'm probably still thinking about some of my object level examples wrong, and hope that if so, commenters will point out my mistakes. But I think I'll stand by the claim that we should be attempting to distinguish between these classes of argument.\n\nMy list of reasons to maybe use worst-case thinking\n---------------------------------------------------\n\nHere's an attempt at describing some different classes situations where you might want to argue that something goes as badly as it could.\n\n### You're being optimized against\n\nFor example, if you've built an unaligned AI and you have a team of ten smart humans looking for hidden gotchas in its proposed actions, then the unaligned AI will probably come up with a way of doing something bad that the humans miss. In AI alignment, we most often think about cases where the AI we're training is optimizing against us, but sometimes we also need to think about cases where other AIs or other humans are optimizing against us or our AIs.\n\nIn situations like this, I think Eliezer's attitude is basically right: we're being optimized against and so we have to use worst-case thinking and search hard for systems which we can strongly argue are infallible.\n\nOne minor disagreement: I'm less into hard takeoffs than he is, so I place less weight than he does on situations where your AI becomes superintelligent enough during training that it can exploit some kind of novel physics to jump an airgap or whatever. (Under my model, such a model probably just waits until it's deployed to the internet-which is one of the first things that AGI developers want to do with it, because that's how you make money with a powerful AI-and then kills everyone.)\n\nBut I fundamentally agree with his rejection of arguments of the form \"only a small part of the space of possible AI actions would be devastatingly bad, so things will probably be fine\".\n\nScott Garrabrant writes about an argument like this [here](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/zEvqFtT4AtTztfYC4/optimization-amplifies).\n\n### The space you're selecting over happens to mostly contain bad things\n\nWhen Hubinger et al argue in [section 4.4 of Risks from Learned Optimization](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/r9tYkB2a8Fp4DN8yB/p/zthDPAjh9w6Ytbeks#4_4__Internalization_or_deception_after_extensive_training#4_4__Internalization_or_deception_after_extensive_training) that \"there are more paths to deceptive alignment than to robust alignment,\" they aren't saying that you get a misaligned mesa-optimizer because the base optimizer is trying to produce an agent that is as misaligned as possible, they're saying that even though the base optimizer isn't trying to find a misaligned policy, most policies that it can find are misaligned and so you'll probably get one. But unlike the previous situation, if instead it was the case that 50% of the policies that SGD might find were aligned, then we'd have a 50% chance of surviving, because SGD isn't optimizing against us.\n\nI think that AI alignment researchers often conflate these two classes of arguments. IMO, when you're training an AGI:\n\n* The AI will try to kill you if it's misaligned. So if you remove some but not all strategies that any unaligned AI could use to get through your training process, you haven't made much progress at all.\n* But SGD isn't trying to kill you, and so if there exist rare misaligned models in the model space that could make it through the training process and then kill you, what matters is how common they are, not whether they exist at all. If you never instantiate the model, it never gets a chance to pervert your optimization process (barring crazy scenarios with acausal threats or whatever).\n\n(I noticed that I was making a mistake related to mixing up these two classes on Sunday; I then thought about this some more and wrote this post.)\n\n### You want to solve a problem in as much generality as possible, and so you want to avoid making assumptions that might not hold\n\nThere's a certain sense in which cryptographers make worst-case assumptions in their research. For example, when inventing public key cryptography, cryptographers were asking the question \"Suppose I want to be able to communicate privately with someone, but an eavesdropper is able to read all messages that we send to each other. Is there some way to communicate privately regardless?\"\n\nSuppose someone responded by saying \"It seems like you're making the assumption that someone is spying on your communications all the time. But isn't this unrealistically pessimistic?\"\n\nThe cryptographer's response would be to say \"Sure, it's probably not usually the case that someone is spying on my packets when I send messages over the internet. But when I'm trying to solve the technical problem of ensuring private communication, it's quite convenient to assume a simple and pessimistic threat model. Either I'll find an approach that works in any scenario less pessimistic than the one I solved, or I'll learn that we actually need to ensure some other way that no-one's reading my packets.\"\n\nSimilarly, in the alignment case, sometimes we make pessimistic empirical assumptions when trying to specify settings for our problems, because solutions developed for pessimistic assumptions generalize to easier situations but the converse isn't true.\n\nAs a large-scale example, when we talk about trying to come up with [competitive](https://ai-alignment.com/directions-and-desiderata-for-ai-control-b60fca0da8f4#25b0) solutions to AI alignment, a lot of the motivation isn't the belief that there will be literally no useful global coordination around AI.\n\nA smaller-scale example: When trying to develop schemes for [relaxed adversarial training](https://ai-alignment.com/training-robust-corrigibility-ce0e0a3b9b4d), we assume that we have no access to any interpretability tools for our models. This isn't because we actually believe that we'll have no interpretability tools, it's because we're trying to develop an alternative to relying on interpretability.\n\nThis is kind of similar to the attitude that cryptographers have.\n\n### Aiming your efforts at worlds where you have the biggest marginal impact\n\nSuppose you are unsure how hard the alignment problem is. Maybe you think that humanity's odd's of success are given by [a logistic function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_function) of the difference between how much alignment progress was made and how hard the problem is. When you're considering between a project that gives us a boost in worlds where P(doom) was 50% and projects that help out in worlds where P(doom) was 1% or 99%, you should probably pick the first project, because the derivative of P(doom) with respect to alignment progress is maximized at 50%.\n\nMany prominent alignment researchers estimate P(doom) as substantially less than 50%. Those people often focus on scenarios which are surprisingly bad from their perspective basically for this reason.\n\nAnd conversely, people who think P(doom) > 50% should aim their efforts at worlds that are better than they expected. This is the point that Eliezer makes in [Security Mindset and the Logistic Success Curve](https://intelligence.org/2017/11/26/security-mindset-and-the-logistic-success-curve/): the security-minded character thinks that it's so unlikely that a particular security-lax project will succeed at building a secure system that she doesn't think it's worth her time to try to help them make marginal improvements to their security.\n\nAnd so, this kind of thinking only pushes you to aim your efforts at surprisingly bad worlds if you're already P(doom) < 50%.\n\nThis type of thinking is common among people who are thinking about global catastrophic biological risks. I don't know of any public documents that are specifically about this point, but you can see an example of this kind of reasoning in Andrew Snyder-Beattie's [Peak defence vs trough defence in biosecurity](https://forum.effectivealtruism.org/posts/w4LRTGCJFFQn6mYKS/peak-defense-vs-trough-defense-in-biosecurity).\n\n### Murphyjitsu\n\nSometimes a problem involves a bunch of weird things that could go wrong, and in order to get good outcomes, it has to be the case that all of them go well. For example, I don't think that \"a terrorist infiltrates the team of labellers who are being used to train the AGI and poisons the data\" is a very likely AI doom scenario. But I think there are probably 100 scenarios as plausible as that one, each of which sounds kind of bad. And I think it's probably worth some people's time to try to stamp out all these individually unlikely failure modes.\n\n### Planning fallacy\n\nRyan Greenblatt notes that you can also make a general reference class claim that people are too optimistic (planning fallacy etc.).\n\nDifferences between these arguments\n-----------------------------------\n\nDepending on which of these arguments you're making, you should respond very differently when someone says \"the thing you're proposing is quite far fetched\".\n\n* If the situation involves being optimized against, you say \"I agree that that action would be quite a weird action among actions. But there's a powerful optimization process selecting for actions like that action. So I expect it to happen anyway. To persuade me otherwise, you need to either claim that there isn't adversarial selection, or that bad actions either don't exist or are so hard to find that an adversary won't possibly be able to find them.\"\n* If you think that the situation involves a random process selecting over a space that is almost all bad, then you should say \"Actually I disagree, I think that in fact the situation we're talking about is probably about as bad as I'm saying; we should argue about what the distribution actually looks like.\"\n* If you are making worst-case assumptions as part of your problem-solving process, then you should say \"I agree that this situation seems sort of surprisingly bad. But I think we should try to solve it anyway, because solving it gives us a solution that is likely to work no matter what the empirical situation turns out to be, and I haven't yet been convinced that my pessimistic assumptions make my problem impossible.\"\n* If you're making worst-case assumptions because you think that P(doom) is low and you are focusing on scenarios you agree are worse than expected, you should say \"I agree that this situation seems sort of surprisingly bad. But I want to work on the situations where I can make the biggest difference, and I think that these surprisingly bad situations are the highest-leverage ones to work on.\"\n* If you're engaging in Murphyjistu, you should say \"Yeah this probably won't come up, but it still seems like a good idea to try and crush all these low-probability mechanisms by which something bad might happen.\"\n\nMary Phuong proposes breaking this down into two questions:\n\n* When should you believe things will go badly, because they in fact will go badly? (you're being optimized against, or the probability of badness is high for some other reason)\n* When should you focus your efforts on worlds where things go badly? I.e. it's about which parts of the distribution you intervene on, rather than an argument about what the distribution looks like."
