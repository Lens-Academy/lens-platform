## The Core Idea

Why might the long-run future come faster than we think?

The basic idea is that once AI systems become capable enough to significantly accelerate AI research itself, we could see a feedback loop: better AI leads to faster AI progress, which leads to even better AI, and so on.

This is sometimes called an "intelligence explosion" or "recursive self-improvement."

## Why Intelligence Helps Create More Intelligence

Consider what's needed to make AI systems smarter:
- Research and experimentation
- Writing and debugging code
- Running experiments
- Analyzing results

These are all cognitive tasks. An AI system that's good at cognitive tasks could potentially do AI research faster than humans.

## Key Questions

1. How fast could this feedback loop run?
2. What would trigger it?
3. Can we predict when we're close?
