COMMITMENT AND ENDOGENOUS THREATS
7.1.
Introduction
The bargaining problems with fixed disagreement actions studied in the pre-
vious chapters can be understood as representing the last ‘phase’ of some more
complex negotiation model in which the parties choose the disagreement ac-
tions prior to the negotiations. This point of view requires that the ‘fixed’
disagreement actions will be carried out if the parties are called upon to do so.
This means that either players are committed upon these disagreement actions
and cannot alter these actions if actually called upon to act, or the disagreement
actions can be changed at will but these actions are anticipated as being credible,
i.e., equilibrium actions, in case of a breakdown.
The ability to commit can be regarded as a powerful ingredient in negotia-
tions. Intuitively, the underlying idea is that once a negotiator has convinced
his opponents that he will not retreat from a specific course of action during the
process, the opponents may decide to concede to his demands. Hence, deliber-
ately reducing one’s flexibility in the bargaining process may induce the other
side to behave in a way that is favorable to the committed player. In this sense,
we may say that in bargaining ‘weakness may also represent a strength’. This
was already understood by Thomas Schelling who was one of the first to infor-
mally explore the role, credibility and feasibility of commitment mechanisms in
bargaining situations, e.g. Schelling (1960). In his view a bargaining process
represents a struggle between negotiators to commit themselves to favorable
bargaining positions. Obviously, the credibility of the mechanism which en-
forces these commitments is of great importance. A commitment which lacks
credibility looses its strategic effect against rival opponents and they will merely
regard this commitment action as a way of ‘tactical bluffing’ and act accord-
175

ingly. Schelling further suggested that mutual incompatible commitments may
cause bargaining impasses.
As lucidly described in Dixit and Nalebuff (1991), ‘burning one’s bridges’
provides a good example of credible commitment. In the sixteenth century, in
his conquest of Mexico, upon arrival in Cempoalla, Cortès commanded that
all but one of his ships had to be destroyed, thus making an unconditional
commitment to fight rather than to retreat. For his soldiers, although vastly
outnumbered, there was no choice: to fight and win, or to loose and die. In fact,
destroying the ships gave Cortès two advantages. First, his camp was unified,
each soldier knowing that they would all fight till the end since desertion or
even retreat was impossible. Second, and more important, was the effect this
irreversible commitment to fight had on the enemy. The enemy knew that
Cortès could only win or die, while they had the option to retreat into the
hinterland. In the end, they chose to retreat rather than to fight such a determined
opponent. The burning down of ships and Cortès’ soldiers knowing it created
a credible commitment to fight. If Cortès had failed it might well have seemed
as an act of suicide. Yet, because he was victorious, it was the fruit of good
strategic contemplation.1 Still, these strategic commitment devices are at play in
everyday bargaining situations. Consider for example a labour union engaged
in collective wage bargaining which takes a firm position at the bargaining table
by announcing a massive strike. It cannot back out from this announcement
without ‘losing its face’. If employers believe this to be true, then they may
ultimately be better off by giving in to the union’s demands.
In this chapter endogenous disagreement actions and the ability (not) to
commit are studied in the simplest setting as is possible in order to understand
the difference between the two notions. The natural starting point is Nash’s
variable-threat game, which is a simple two-stage model in which the parties
commit themselves on their disagreement actions prior to the negotiations. This
model can be easily modified to study negotiations without commitment, which
we intend to do. Moreover, the negotiations in Nash’s variable-threat game are
modelled as Nash’s demand game and, as extensively argued in section 4.3,
the parties’ demands can be regarded as representing the behavioural strategies
of some underlying, unspecified dynamic bargaining process. The alternating
offers procedure could represent this unspecified bargaining model given that it
yields similar results. Therefore, it is obvious to replace Nash’s demand game
by the alternating offers model and study the issue of commitment versus no
commitment in greater detail. Nevertheless, doing so does not yield duplicated
results as will be seen below. Recall from chapter 6 that despite the rigid order
of moves in the alternating offers model this procedure produces results that are
robust if endogenous timing or some randomized sequence of proposing parties
is taken into account.

This chapter is organized as follows. The starting point of the analysis is
the introduction of Nash’s variable threat game in the next section. After a
brief analysis the unspecified negotiation process is explicitly modelled as the
alternating offers procedure and the consequences are studied. Then, in the
subsequent section, both models are studied under the assumption that play-
ers cannot commit themselves meaning that disagreement actions are chosen
only in case of a breakdown. We note that the models without commitment
can be regarded as simple in terms of mathematical complexity, because it is
assumed that disagreement actions played in case of a terminal breakdown have
no feedback on future behaviour in the negotiations (which are over by then).
7.2.
Optimal threats with commitment
The simplest modification in terms of complexity is the extension in which
the threats are chosen prior to the negotiations. As mentioned earlier, this
requires that the players are committed to their disagreement actions if called
upon to carry them out and players cannot back out from these actions. In the
first subsection, Nash’s variable-threat game is introduced and analyzed. Then,
in the subsequent subsection, Nash’s demand game that constitutes the second
stage of the variable-threat game is replaced by the alternating offers procedure.
7.2.1
Nash’s original variable-threat game
One of the first strategic bargaining games where players can influence the
disagreement outcome was analyzed, not surprisingly, by Nash himself. In a
now classical paper, e.g., Nash (1953), an elegant two-stage negotiation game
is introduced, which is usually dubbed as Nash’s variable-threat game. In the
first stage, the players commit themselves to threats prior to the negotiations
which they have to carry out in case they fail to reach an agreement in the
second stage. In this second stage the players simultaneously play Nash’s
demand game of section 4.3.1. The multiplicity of equilibria in the latter model
is resolved by resorting to the H-essential equilibrium of the demand game.
The latter means that the parties agree upon the axiomatic Nash bargaining
solution and the choice of threats in the first stage actually determines the
equilibrium agreement through the disagreement outcome in the second stage.
As a consequence, every player tries to choose its threat such as to increase its
final payoff when agreement is struck.
For notational convenience, we briefly mention some of the notation already
introduced in chapter 2. This means that the triple
specifies the non-empty and convex set S of attainable utility pairs, player
set 
of ‘threats’ and player 
utility function 
over the set of disagreement
outcomes A. Assumption 2.7 implies that for each 
there exists an
agreement 
such that 
i.e. mutual interests. This means

that the Pareto frontier in terms of utility pairs associated with disagreement
outcomes in the set A lies to the south-west of the Pareto frontier of the set
S. Alternatively, we may regard the last two ingredients as representing a two-
player game in normal form characterized by
where {1, 2} denotes the set of players, 
denotes player 
set of ‘threats’
and 
denotes player 
utility function.
Nash’s variable-threat game is a two-stage game with almost perfect infor-
mation, with two players and both players simultaneously and independently of
each other choose their actions in each stage. In the first stage of the game, each
player 
chooses his threat 
Each player’s threat determines
this player’s disagreement action in case the negotiations of the second stage
break down and it is assumed that each player is committed to his threat in case
of such breakdown. Once the threats have been chosen by the players, each
player observes the threat chosen by his opponent. Then the game moves to the
second stage which consists of Nash’s demand game, as already described in
section 4.3.1. Briefly recalling, the players simultaneously and independently
state their demands 
in terms of utility and if the players’ demands are
compatible, i.e. 
then both demands can be fulfilled, each player ob-
taining 
and the game ends. If both demands are incompatible, i.e.
then players fail to reach agreement and have to carry out their threats
each player securing 
and the game ends. The formal
definition of Nash’s variable-threat game is as follows.
Bargaining Procedure 7.1.  Nash’s variable-threat game is the two-stage game
with almost perfect information characterized by the set of players N = {1, 2},
player
threat
in the first stage, player
demand
in the second stage, and player
utility function
where the indicator function 
is defined in bargaining procedure 4.29.
As argued in chapter 2 the equilibrium concept for multi-stage games with
almost-perfect information is the SPE concept. Unfortunately, this concept
is rather weak in Nash’s variable-threat game, because it only imposes that
a Nash equilibrium of the demand game is played in the second stage. As
already discussed in section 4.3.1, under quite general conditions the Nash
demand game admits a continuum of equilibria: any possible agreement which
is both Pareto efficient and individually rational corresponds to a particular Nash
equilibrium. In the variable-threat game this multiplicity problem aggravates,
because the SPE strategies allow for the Nash equilibrium to depend upon
the threats 
chosen in the first stage. Formally, every vector function
describes the players’ SPE strategies in the second stage of the
threat game if and only if 
is a Nash equilibrium of Nash’s
demand game. In order to deal with this indeterminacy, John Nash proposed the
equilibrium selection described in section 4.3.1. In modern terminology, the

179
H-essential equilibrium concept is applied to the second stage and according
to theorem 4.31 the unique H-essential equilibrium of the second stage is given
by 
for 
So, the players’ demands coincide with
the axiomatic Nash bargaining solution of chapter 4. Recall that this solution
is Pareto efficient, which is important in the sequel.
Having ‘solved’ the SPE strategies for the second stage means that the anal-
ysis continues with deriving the optimal threats in the first stage of the variable-
threat game. Imposing the H-essential equilibrium outcome of the demand
game as the SPE continuation in the variable-threat game means that both play-
ers anticipate agreement upon 
in the second stage.
Then the SPE actions in the first stage of the threat game correspond to the Nash
equilibrium actions of the game in normal form in which 
repre-
sents player 
set of feasible actions and 
represents player
utility. In Nash (1953) it is argued that the latter game is strategically equiv-
alent to a zero-sum game, because Pareto efficiency of the agreement implies
that an improvement enforced by one player is at the expense of his opponent.
This equivalence has several important implications. First, zero-sum games
are known to have a unique value meaning that there exists a unique number
that expresses player 1’s Nash equilibrium utility and, due to the antagonistic
character of zero-sum games, it also expresses player 2’s utility. Translated to
the threat game, this means that there is uniqueness in terms of a unique utility
pair on the Pareto frontier. So, the threat game resolves in a unique Pareto effi-
cient agreement. With respect to the equilibrium threats, (generic) uniqueness
cannot be established, because zero-sum games like all other games often admit
multiple Nash equilibria for a generic class of problems.2
Second, all Nash equilibrium actions in zero-sum games are minmax strate-
gies and vice versa. A minmax strategy for player 1 maximizes this player’s
worst outcome his opponent can impose upon him and, due to the antagonistic
setting, player 2 has every incentive to keep player 1 down at his lowest utility
level. Translated to the threat game this means that 
are SPE
disagreement actions in the first stage if and only if
So, player 1 wants to pull the bargaining solution along the Pareto frontier in
the south-east direction, whereas his opponent wants to pull it in the opposite
direction. Finally, minmax strategies are said to be interchangeable meaning
that if 
and 
are both minmax strategies for player 
then both actions
do equally well against all of his opponents minmax actions and player can
choose any of these two actions regardless of what his opponent will choose.
This implies that the players in a zero-sum game that admits multiple Nash
equilibria do not have the coordination problem of playing the same Nash

equilibrium actions as other games in normal form have, as for example the
battle of the sexes.
We state the following proposition without further proof.

in the second stage.

threat game if and only if for both

All SPE strategies result in the same Pareto efficient agreement in S, i.e.,

This proposition is illustrated in the following proposition.
Example 7.3. Consider the class of variable-threat games such that the set S
is given by
The H-essential equilibrium concept singles out the equilibrium demands
in the second stage that are given by
According to theorem 7.2, in choosing optimal threats, player 1 tries to maximize
the quantity 
whereas player 2 tries to minimize this same
quantity. Effectively, this means that the players play a zero-sum game in which
represents player 1’s utility function. The optimal threats
need to constitute a Nash equilibrium of this zero-sum game.
7.2.2
The variable-threat game with alternating offers
As argued in section 4.3.2, John Nash thought of the demands as represent-
ing the players’ strategies of some unspecified bargaining procedure. In this
section we replace the demand game by one specific bargaining procedure, be-
ing the procedure with alternating offers. Since this procedure showed quite
some robustness with respect to alternative bargaining procedures, as shown in
chapter 6, there is not much loss in generality by choosing this specific bargain-
ing procedure. At first glance the reader might consider this exercise as being
trivial, because the unique SPE of the alternating offers also corresponds to the
Nash bargaining solution. However, we will show that the results of theorem
7.2 need to be modified unless some additional assumption is imposed.
Like in the previous section we consider bargaining problems in utility repre-
sentation 
The choice of the threats takes place prior

to the negotiations and, similar as before, we adopt the convention that the first
bargaining round takes place at 
meaning that the choice of disagreement
actions takes place at let’s say 
It is again assumed that each player
perfectly observes the other player’s choice of disagreement actions before the
negotiations start at round 
and this guarantees that the players have per-
fect information in the bargaining process. For explanatory reasons we think of
as representing the probability of a next bargaining round. By doing
so, a breakdown is an irreversible event once it occurs. A novel feature is that
we assume that the players may condition their disagreement actions upon the
bargaining round in which breakdown occurs. Therefore, the players choose
an infinite sequence of actions 
before the negotiations start.
Let us therefore state the informally described bargaining procedure.
Bargaining Procedure 7.4.
Round –1:
Player
chooses the infinite sequence of disagreement actions
Round
Player 1 proposes an offer
and, then, player 2 either accepts (‘yes’) or
rejects (‘no’) the offer 
If player 2 accepts, then the negotiations end and the
players implement the offer 
yielding a final utility 
in round
However, if player 2 rejects, then with probability 
the bargaining
process continues to the next round 
and with probability 
the bar-
gaining process breaks down forever and the players are committed to carry
out the pair of disagreement actions chosen at round –1 with associated pair
of utilities
Round
The procedure is similar as for 
is even except that now player 2 has the
initiative to propose an offer 
and, afterwards, player 1 responds.
As in Nash’s variable-threat game the bargaining procedure is a multi-stage
game with almost-perfect information and the SPE concept is appropriate. This
implies that the alternating offers has to be solved for every possibly infinite
sequence of actions 
Since these actions change over time, the
disagreement point 
will also vary over time, which include the special
case of alternating disagreement points studied in section 6.3.2. Recall that
alternating disagreement points cause the technical problem that the standard
analysis is only applicable if some ‘constructed’ disagreement point is taken
into account. The latter point may lie above the Pareto frontier of the set S
and generic multiplicity cannot be ruled out. In this section we want to avoid
these technical problems by restricting the analysis to the class of normalized

This implicitly means that we also impose

Consider an arbitrary subgame starting at the first bargaining round after the
players have chosen their disagreement actions. This means that the infinite
sequence of actions 
is given and observed by the two players.
The corresponding subgame is equivalent to a non-stationary version of the
alternating offers procedure, because the disagreement actions may vary over
time. The first lemma states the unique SPE payoff of the subgame starting at
the first bargaining round. A proof can be found in Busch and Wen (1995) and
is therefore omitted.
Lemma 7.5. For every infinite sequence of disagreement actions 
the
alternating offers process admits a unique SPE. Moreover, at 
the players
immediately agree upon the SPE proposal 
given by
and
Having solved for the SPE utilities at 
means that the choice of the
equilibrium disagreement actions at 
simply boils down to playing a
normal-form game in which player 
chooses an infinite sequence
of actions
with payoff function 
Moreover, this normal-
form game is equivalent to a zero-sum game, which is similar as in Nash’s
variable-threat game.
This zero-sum game is easy to solve. First, the utility function
is linear in the disagreement payoffs 
and 
and inde-
pendent of the disagreement payoffs 
and 
Therefore, we
can divide the ‘large’ zero-sum game into infinitely many smaller subproblems,
each of them also being a zero-sum game. So, 
is found by solving
the smaller zero-sum game with player 1’s utility function equal to
The unique value of this smaller zero-sum game is simply the minmax value, as
explained in section 7.2.1. Now, von Neumann’s famous minmax theorem for
two-player zero-sum games states that the minmax value is equal to the minmax
value, e.g., von Neumann (1928) or Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green (1995).
Hence, player 2’s value for this zero-sum game is equal to his minmax value
as already defined in chapter 2. Formally, the pair of SPE disagreement

where the argument, i.e., arg, only refers to the maximization. For a good
understanding: The action 
corresponds to player 1’s minmax strategy that
keeps player 2 at the utility level 
Recall from chapter 2 that the set of
actions that minmax player 2 is denoted as 
Similar, the SPE disagreement
actions 
solve the smaller zero-sum game in which player
1’s utility function is equal to 
and the corresponding minmax actions
are
This implies that the (mixed) actions in

actions in a two-player zero-sum game with payoff functions

for the other player. As in chapter 2, the set of actions
that minmax player 1 is denoted as

From proposition 7.6 it is clear that the equilibrium disagreement actions
alternate over time. Moreover, the disagreement actions are independent of the
probability 
This result is quite different from the result obtained in theorem
7.2 or, given the linear Pareto frontier, example 7.3, where the disagreement
actions are equilibrium actions of the zero-sum game with player 1’s utility

to the

Doing so, would mean that
and the SPE threats 
solve a zero-sum game in which player 1’s utility is
given by 
Thus, the associated equilibrium threats now depend
upon the probability 
Then, as 
goes to 1, the player 1’s utility function
converges to this player’s utility function as derived in example 7.3. Without
going into the details, it can be shown that the set of Nash equilibria is upper
semi-continuous in 
and this suffices for the set of SPE disagreement
actions corresponding to 
to converge to some subset of the set of
optimal threats of example 7.3. Thus, we have arrived at the following theorem.
Theorem 7.7. Let the set of sequences 
be restricted to sequences such
that 
Then, as 
goes to 1, the limit set of SPE disagreement
actions of bargaining procedure 7.4 is contained in the set of SPE disagreement
utilities in Nash’s variable threat game.
Note that the limit set of Nash equilibrium of theorem 7.7 is always contained
in the set of equilibrium actions corresponding to Nash’s variable-threat game
and that it could be a strict subset in which case this limit set can be regarded as a
refinement.3 In the previous section the H-essential equilibrium was proposed
on an ad hoc basis, whereas the analysis in this section can be regarded as a
more plausible underpinning. First, the demand game represents the reduced
normal-form of the alternating offers model and, second, players are not allowed
to condition their disagreement actions upon the exact bargaining round in case
of a breakdown occurs. So, we may say that in Nash (1953) it is implicitly
assumed that the disagreement actions 
are constant, i.e. 
for
all 
during the underlying unspecified dynamic bargaining process. If the
players are able to condition the disagreement actions upon the exact round of
breakdown, then the actions drift away from the equilibrium threats in Nash’s
variable-threat game.
7.3.
Credible threats without commitment
The assumption of commitment is restrictive in that it requires an adequate
enforcement mechanism for the players to stick to their threats in case of break-
down. Without commitment each player is free to choose his disagreement
actions in case of a breakdown and each player will only carry out a previously
announced threat if it is still in the best interest of this party to do so. The SPE
threats derived in the previous section often induce a player to choose a threat
which may indeed hurt himself if he is forced to carry it out. Thus, we can
not expect that the SPE threats under commitment survive in any environment

Commitment and endogenous threats
185
where an adequate enforcement is proven infeasible and this calls for a new
analysis, which is conducted in this section.
In the first section we remove the enforcement of commitment in Nash’s
variable-threat game. This means that the players cannot commit themselves
upon the disagreement actions before the negotiations start. Instead, the players
choose their disagreement actions only in case of a breakdown. In this section
also briefly touch upon the question whether or not the parties would choose to
commit if adequate enforcement would be at their disposal. Then we proceed
by replacing the unspecified negotiation process thought to underlie Nash’s
demand game by the alternating offers process. The latter model also serves
as a first step to the more complex bargaining models that are postponed to
subsequent chapters. The analysis is conducted in several subsections. In the
first equilibria in Markov strategies are investigated. Then the set of SPE utility
pairs is characterized and necessary and sufficient conditions for uniqueness
are derived. Finally, the limit set of SPE utility pairs is investigated as the risk
of breakdown vanishes.
One remark is in place. Here, the disagreement actions are chosen in case
of a breakdown and, therefore, the players’ past behaviour in the negotiations
can influence the disagreement actions but not vice versa. The absence of this
feedback will be restored in latter chapters.
7.3.1
Nash’s variable-threat game: no commitment
In case the enforcement of commitment is removed from Nash’s variable-
threat game the players choose their disagreement actions only in case of a
breakdown. So, disagreement actions are no longer chosen prior to the negoti-
ations but after the negotiations ended, i.e., a permanent breakdown occurred,
meaning the demand game is played first and only in case of incompatible
demands the disagreement actions are chosen.
From here on we consider the triple 
without addi-
tional assumptions other than the by now standard assumptions made in chap-
ter 2. Recall that the assumption of mutual interests means that the Pareto
frontier in terms of utility pairs associated with disagreement outcomes in the
set A lies to the south-west of the Pareto frontier of the set S. The last two
terms of the triple specify the disagreement game in case of a breakdown. The
assumptions made in chapter 2 ensure that the set of Nash equilibria of this
disagreement game, denoted as 
is a non-empty and compact set.
The formal definition of Nash’s variable-threat game without commitment
runs now as follows.
Bargaining Procedure 7.8. Nash’s variable-threat game without commitment
is the two-stage game with almost perfect information characterized by the set of
players N = {1, 2} and player
demand 
in the first stage. In

case 
i.e., compatible demands, the negotiations end with the agreement
Otherwise, the game proceeds to the second stage where player chooses
his threat 
Player 
utility function
where the indicator function
is defined in bargaining procedure 4.29.
As before, the two-stage game has almost perfect information and the SPE
concept is the appropriate solution concept. Note that strategies specify actions
at the second stage conditional upon the history 
meaning that strategies
prescribe some function 
that specifies player
action at the second stage. Now, application of the SPE concept implies that
the actions played at the final stage of the game are Nash equilibrium actions.
Thus, every SPE strategy satisfies 
for all 
The simplest
functions specify the same Nash equilibrium for every subgame, i.e. there
exists a 
such that 
for all 
The latter is the only
possibility in case the disagreement game admits a single Nash equilibrium.
However, with multiple Nash equilibria in the disagreement game numerous
discontinuous functions can also be constructed, but we will not pursue this
line of research. So, for explanatory simplicity we assume SPE functions of
the first form only.
At the first stage, the players have to state their demands while both anticipate
the same Nash equilibrium 
to be played in case of incompatible
demands. It will be clear that for every 
the multiplicity of equilibrium
demands as discussed in section 4.3.1 arises. Thus, the SPE concept has too little
bite in the two-stage game and, again, we resort to the H-essential equilibrium
of the demand game to obtain some results. Doing so means that we simply
characterize SPE strategies as follows: For some 
the SPE demands in
the first stage are 
and the disagreement actions
for all 
These strategies induce agreement upon the compatible
demands 
at the first stage and permanent breakdown never
occurs, i.e., the second stage is never reached along any SPE path.
Proposition 7.9. Consider the class of SPE strategies in which for some
the threats 
and the players play the H-essential equilibrium
at the first stage. Then these strategies are SPE strategies if
and only if
Moreover, the set of SPE outcomes consists of the set of
compatible demands (or agreements)
From this results it follows that the ability (not) to commit has a huge im-
pact on the type of results that can be obtained. First, at the heart of Nash’s
variable-threat game lies the assumption of irrevocable commitment to the
ex-ante specified threats 
However, note that in general the SPE dis-
agreement actions of theorem 7.2 do not constitute a Nash equilibrium of the

187
disagreement game, i.e. 
as is clearly demonstrated by example 7.24.
This simple observation alone requires the existence of some strong commit-
ment device, because, by definition, in a non-cooperative environment players
cannot be assumed to play one-shot non-credible actions. As Nash (1953), (p.
130), puts it:
... we must assume there is an adequate mechanism for forcing the players to stick to
heir threats and demands once made; and one to enforce the bargain, once agreed. Thus,
we need a sort of umpire, who will enforce contracts or commitments.
Proposition 7.9 states a one-to-one relationship between the Nash equilib-
rium actions in 
and the set of SPE outcomes, provided the class of SPE
strategies is restricted. Note that we no longer can guarantee uniqueness of
the SPE agreement as in Nash’s variable-threat game unless all Nash equilib-
ria of the disagreement game result in the same agreement, i.e., there exists a
such that 
for all 
The latter condition can
be reinterpreted in terms of the second geometrical property of the axiomatic
Nash bargaining solution, as discussed in section 4.2.2. Consider one particular
and suppose the function 
(or 
that describes the Pareto frontier
of S, i.e., 
lies on the Pareto frontier, is differentiable. Then unique-
ness requires that for all 
the line through 
and
coincides with the line through for 
and 
So, in order to
have a unique SPE agreement all disagreement points corresponding to Nash
equilibria of the disagreement game should lie on one line and all the associated
SPE demands 
should also lie on this line. This condition trivially holds for
the class of disagreement games that admit a single Nash equilibrium. How-
ever, outside this class this condition is nongeneric. This implies the following
proposition.4
Proposition 7.10. Let
be differentiable. Then Nash’s variable-threat game
without commitment admits a unique SPE agreement if
consists of a single
element and it generically admits multiple SPE agreements otherwise.
This result implies that the uniqueness of the SPE agreement obtained for the
case with commitment is only partially preserved. Since disagreement points
are linked in both models to the compatible SPE demands in the same manner
and SPE threats differ, this implies that the SPE agreements are different as
well.
To conclude, suppose the possibility of some costless but strong commit-
ment device is available to each of the players and that each player has a choice
whether or not to commit upon his threat prior to the negotiations, where a
player who does not wish to commit remains flexible in choosing his disagree-
ment point in case of a breakdown. What should each player do? Commit
or remain flexible? In Mao (1993) this important question is addressed. The
answer is that each player chooses to commit himself prior to the negotiations.

188
CREDIBLE THREATS IN NEGOTIATIONS
The underlying intuition is rather simple. Suppose that both players do not
commit. Then a deviation by let us say player 1 to commit himself prior to
the negotiations means that this player sets his threat before his opponent does
and that his opponent has to react to player 1’s choice, which cannot be un-
done due to the commitment. Then player 1 can be regarded as the leader in
the famous Stackelberg equilibrium from industrial organization, e.g., Fuden-
berg and Tirole (1991), Mas-Colell, Whinston, and Green (1995) and Tirole
(1988), and it is known that the leader can always obtain the Nash equilibrium
profit of the symmetric Cournot or Bertrand model, whichever is considered.
Manoeuvering oneself in the position of the ‘leader’ is not only profitable in
the Stackelberg model, but also in the negotiations with endogenous threats
for the same underlying reason. So, both players refraining from committing
themselves cannot be an SPE outcome. In Mao (1993) it is further shown that
the outcome in which one player refrains from committing himself cannot be
an SPE outcome either, because this player can do better by choosing to com-
mit himself upon a suitable threat. Hence, if costless commitment devices are
available, both players will commit themselves.
7.3.2
Variable threats with alternating offers:
no commitment
For similar reasons as in section 7.2.2 we replace the demand game by the
alternating offers procedure and investigate SPE utility pairs. In this section the
bargaining procedure is specified and SPE in Markov strategies are derived. In
the subsequent sections we derive upper and lower bounds upon the players’
SPE utilities and characterize the set of SPE utility pairs.
Consider the class of triples 
that satisfy the as-
sumptions made in chapter 2. Bargaining procedure 7.8 is modified to allow
for alternating offers and becomes the following bargaining procedure.
Bargaining Procedure 7.11.
Round
Player 1 proposes an offer
and, then, player 2 either accepts (‘yes’) or
rejects (‘no’) the offer
If player 2 accepts, then the negotiations end and
the players implement the offer 
yielding a final utility 
in round
However, if player 2 rejects, then with probability 
the bargaining
process continues to the next round 
and with probability 
the bar-
gaining process breaks down forever and players play the disagreement game
once that determines the final disagreement outcome
Round
The procedure is similar except that now player 1 has the initiative to propose
an offer 
and, afterwards, player 1 responds.

As before, this bargaining procedure is a multi-stage game with almost per-
fect information and we therefore apply the SPE concept. As in section 7.3.1
the strategies specify disagreement actions in round 
in case of a break-
down at this round conditional upon the history 
meaning that strategies
prescribes some function 
that specify player
action at the second stage. Now, application of the SPE concept implies that the
actions played at the final stage of the game are Nash equilibrium actions. Thus,
every SPE strategy satisfies 
for all 
including
a permanent breakdown in round 
The following lemma summarizes the main
results in this (sub)section.
Lemma 7.12. Consider a pair of strategies 
such that

agreement actions at round

Recall from section 2.3.8 that Markov strategies are, loosely stated, restricted
to the ‘payoff-relevant’ history of the play. For the bargaining model under
consideration, Markov strategies ignore all past offers that have been rejected
and do not condition the disagreement actions on the bargaining round in which
breakdown occurs. Formally, this means that Markov strategies impose (among
others) that there exists an

The full derivation of MPE strategies then becomes almost trivial. Since the
disagreement actions do not depend upon time nor on the history of proposals
during the negotiations we can replace the infinite sequence of endogenous
disagreement points by a time-independent disagreement point and analyze the

the standard alternating offers of chapter 3, where is equal to

to the following proposition.

to 1, both 
and 
converge to the axiomatic Nash
bargaining solution N (S, 
).
Note that each Nash equilibrium in 
corresponds to one particular pair
of MPE strategies in the bargaining model. Since the set 
is non-empty it
immediately follows that the set of Markov perfect equilibria is non-empty as
well. Hence, this implies existence of at least one such equilibrium.
7.3.3
Bounds for SPE utilities
Upper and lower bounds upon SPE utilities are derived by modifying the
method of Shaked and Sutton, as extensively discussed in section 3.4.1. Lower
and upper bounds upon SPE utilities require knowledge of these bounds in the
‘final’ subgame associated with permanent breakdown. Since SPE disagree-
ment actions correspond to some pair of actions in 
contingent upon the
exact history of the negotiations each player’s lowest and highest utilities in the
final subgame coincide with this player’s extreme Nash equilibria in

Before deriving the lower and upper bounds on the players’ SPE payoffs, we
postulate a pair of strategies with alternating disagreement actions and show
that these strategies are SPE strategies. The rationale is simple. Consider a
linear Pareto frontier and player 1’s utility of lemma 7.5 once more, i.e.,
Observe that player 1’s utility depends positively on his disagreement payoff
if breakdown occurs in a round in which player 1 responds, and
negatively on player 2’s disagreement payoff 
if breakdown occurs in a
round in which player 2 is the responding player. Therefore, in order to incur the
greatest loss of delay on player 1’s utility given that SPE disagreement actions
always belong to 
player 1’s disagreement utility 
are
minimized if the actions 
are played in case of a breakdown in every even
period. The opposite case applies to player 2’s disagreement utilities
that are maximized by the actions 
in case of a breakdown in every
odd period. The latter actions minimize the loss of delay on player 2’s payoff
and, thereby, strengthen his bargaining position. So, player 1’s utility becomes
This idea also works in general, especially because lemma 7.14 ensures that
the constructed disagreement point 
lies below the Pareto frontier
of 
This rules out the multiplicity encountered in section 6.3.2. The
informally described strategies are formally presented by table 7.2 for general
bargaining problems, where 
and 
refer to the unique fixed point
of the function

The next proposition states that the

192

strategies of table 7.2 are SPE. As will be shown in theorem 7.17 below these
SPE strategies constitute player 1’s worst pair of SPE strategies.
Proposition 7.15. Let 
and 
form the unique
fixed point of the function 
for 
where 
is defined in
(3.1). Then the strategies of table 7.2 are SPE strategies for all
Moreover,
By reversing the roles of both players in the previous proposition we obtain
player 2’s worst pair of SPE strategies.
Proposition 7.16. Let 
and 
form the unique
fixed point of the function 
for 
Then the strategies that are
obtained by reversing the roles of the players in table 7.2 are SPE strategies for
all 
Moreover,
Note that the strategies of table 7.2 are non-Markov, since the disagreement
actions played in case of breakdown do depend on the specific bargaining round
in which breakdown occurs.
Obviously the main question now concerns whether the strategies of propo-
sition 7.15 correspond to player 1’s worst SPE utility. The following theorem
states an affirmative answer. Its proof is based upon the method of Shaked and
Sutton, as introduced in section 3.4.1.
Theorem 7.17. For all 
it holds that the pair of SPE strategies in
proposition 7.15 constitute player 1’s pair of worst SPE strategies. Similar, the
pair of SPE strategies in corollary 7.16 constitute player 1’s pair of worst SPE
strategies for all
From this theorem a similar conclusion as at the end of section 7.2.2 can
be drawn with respect to the results for bargaining procedure 7.8. Namely,
theorem 7.17 reveals the implicit assumption that the strategies in the bargaining
process underlying the modified variable-threat game in bargaining procedure
7.8 need to be Markov strategies. This implicit restriction to Markov strategies
implies that disagreement actions are constant over time and have to be Nash
equilibrium actions, that is, 
for all and 
If the unspecified
bargaining procedure is modelled as the alternating offers procedure, then richer
SPE strategies emerge and a possibly larger set of SPE utility pairs arises.
7.3.4 
The set of SPE utility pairs
The upper and lower bounds upon the players’ SPE utilities derived in theo-
rem 7.17 enables us to characterize the set of SPE utilities, which is based upon

Commitment and endogenous threats
193
the idea of equilibrium switching, as described in section 5.4.2. The discus-
sion then continues by deriving sufficient and necessary conditions for generic
uniqueness.
As said, the idea of equilibrium switching is employed to characterize the set
of SPE utility pairs. This is accomplished by considering all SPE strategies that
induce immediate agreement upon some possibly inefficient agreement. Equi-
librium switching is already extensively discussed in section 5.4.2 and 5.4.3.
The strategies represented by table 7.3 can be considered as a straightforward
translation of table 5.1 to the situation under consideration. The strategies start
in state ‘IA’, where ‘IA’ stands for immediate agreement. In this initial state
player 1 makes the possible inefficient proposal 
that is accepted by his
opponent. In case player 1 deviates by making a different proposal the strate-
gies prescribe an immediate switch to the SPE strategies in proposition 7.15.
The latter strategies constitute player 1’s most severe equilibrium punishment
and, supposing acceptance by his opponent, this player will not deviate if and
only if 
Similar, player 2 is deterred from rejecting the
proposal 
if and only if 
because rejecting 
induces
an immediate switch to player 2’s most severe equilibrium punishment, i.e., the
SPE strategies in proposition 7.15. Obviously, we have arrived at the following
proposition, where 
denotes the set of SPE utility pairs at the start
of every even bargaining round.
Proposition 7.18. The strategies represented by table 7.3 are SPE strategies
featuringimmediate agreement upon 
at round 
if and only if
and 
for all 
Moreover, the

history independent set of SPE utilities 
at the start of every

given by
Note that this proposition is also valid in case the disagreement game admits
a unique Nash equilibrium, i.e., 
consists of a single element, because then
combining 
and the definition of
the function 
simply imply that
Thus, the upper and lower bounds coincide and the set 
reduces to a single
point on the Pareto frontier.
Without going through all the details, we mention that it is also straightfor-
ward to characterize the history independent set 
of SPE utility pairs at
the subgame that coincides with the start of every odd numbered bargaining
round. This set is given by
Proposition 7.18 also makes it easy to characterize the limit set of SPE utility
pairs. Then we obtain the following results, simply by taking the limit 
goes
to 1.
Theorem 7.19. Let

under which a multiplicity of fixed points of the function 
can be regarded
as coinciding with each other. Since the Nash program is already identified
with the limit 
goes to 1, we investigate the conditions for uniqueness in this
limit, which is a case that is easy to handle.
Consider the limit set of theorem 7.19 once more. 
Obviously, unique-
ness (in the limit) in bargaining procedure 7.11 simply requires that the two
Nash bargaining solutions 
and 
coincide, i.e.,
player proposes. Then for 
it holds that
For 
this task is rather complicated, because conditions have to be specified

Commitment and endogenous threats
195
In order to derive a condition for unique-
ness we make use of the second geometrical property of the Nash bargaining
solution, as discussed in section 4.2.2. For explanatory reasons we suppose
that the Pareto frontier is smooth in the unique point, i.e., the function 
that
describes the this frontier is differentiable in 
Then uniqueness
and the second geometrical property imply that the point 
should lie
on the line through 
and
5 Of course, the latter con-
dition trivially holds for the class of bargaining problems that admit a single
Nash equilibrium in the disagreement game. However, outside this class of
bargaining problems the condition for uniqueness is nongeneric, because slight
changes in the players’ utility functions are sufficient to will shift 
off
this line. This implies the following proposition.
Proposition 7.20. Consider the class of bargaining problems with a smooth
Pareto frontier of S in N(S, 
) for every 
Then bargaining
procedure 7.11 admits a unique SPE agreement if 
consists of a single
element and it generically admits multiple SPE agreements otherwise.
So, this proposition states the same sufficient and almost necessary condition
for uniqueness as in proposition 7.10, namely the set 
should consists of a
unique Nash equilibrium. The latter means that the disagreement game rules out
the coordination problem in case of multiple Nash equilibria. If a coordination
problem over Nash equilibria arises, then this carries over to the negotiations.
Finally, for the case where the Pareto frontier of S is not smooth in the point
N(S, 
),
we refer to section 9.2.5. The results in the latter
section can be easily translated into necessary and sufficient conditions for the
nonsmooth case here.

SPE with delay
Similar as in section 5.4.4 SPE strategies with delay can be supported in
case the necessary and sufficient conditions for uniqueness, as stated in propo-
sition 7.20 do not hold. Recall that the maximum equilibrium delay in sec-
tion 5.4.4 is finite. Here a new feature may arise: Perpetual disagreement
cannot be ruled out if some simple condition holds.
Since equilibrium strategies require that a Nash equilibrium is played in
case of a breakdown we might as well start by considering some
and take this 
as the players’ threats prescribed by the strategies. Re-
call that strategies also induce the intended round 
of agreement
(delay means 
the final agreement 
at

the endogenous risk of breakdown

The question is what are
the equilibrium conditions upon

Similar as in section 5.4.4 we extend
the strategies represented by table 7.3 by imposing a new initial state. In this
initial state players must first make proposals until round 
that are rejected
and we regard 
and 
as natural candidates for these pro-
posals, i.e., the proposing player demands his utopia utility in
and is not
willing to settle for anything less. In case player 
would make
an offer that leaves less to himself than 
then equilibrium switching to
this player’s worst SPE is immediately triggered. At round 
the strategies
move to state IA (immediate agreement) in table 7.3, including the same state
transitions. These modified strategies implement the agreement
at round 
and the players disagree until round

sents the initial state of the strategies that induce delay. Deriving equilibrium

From equilibrium condition (7.6) the maximum delay of any SPE can be
derived and for the details we refer once more to section 5.4.4. However, there
is an interesting difference. With a fixed disagreement point the disagreement
point is always located south-west of the point where both players are at their
minimum SPE utility and this guarantees that the maximum delay has to be
finite. Here, 
corresponds to a Nash equilibrium utility pair and multi-
plicity of SPE outcome is definitely associated with multiple Nash equilibria

in the disagreement game. Now, the following interesting case cannot be ruled
out: The disagreement game may admit a Nash equilibrium 
such
that 
Then for every 
and 
equilibrium
condition (7.6) holds meaning that even 
can be supported by these
SPE strategies. In this special case the negotiations break down with prob-
ability equal to 1 without the players reaching an agreement, i.e., perpetual
disagreement.
Corollary 7.22. If there exists a pair of actions
such that
then for this particular 
and every 
equilibrium condition
(7.6) imposes no maximum bound upon 
Moreover, for every
there is one SPE strategy with perpetual disagreement.
The results obtained can be related to Thomas Schelling’s point of view
mentioned in the introduction of this chapter. If commitment fails the players’
threats have to be credible. In case of multiple Nash equilibria there is an im-
plicit struggle for coordination on one of these equilibria to obtain favourable
bargaining positions. If the Nash equilibrium utilities lie relatively scattered,
this struggle results in an indeterminacy and the possibility that this indetermi-
nacy is never resolved and may cause bargaining impasses.
7.3.6
A comparison between models
In this section the equilibrium outcomes of the two alternating offers proce-
dures with and without commitment on threats are compared with each other.
This is done by first investigating the conditions under which these two models
produce the same equilibrium conditions. For a short analysis we assume that
the Pareto frontier of the bargaining problem is smooth.
Recall from section 7.2.2 that the bargaining procedure with commitment
yields the unique outcome N (S, 
). So, the question becomes when
does the alternating offers procedure without commitment yield the same SPE
outcome. First, the latter outcome has to be unique and for a smooth Pareto
frontier this means that, genetically, the disagreement game may admit at most
one Nash equilibrium. Second, the unique SPE outcome N(S, 
) has to
coincide with N (S, 
). Making use of the second geometrical property,
this means that the unique Nash equilibrium utilities 
have to lie on the
line through 
and N (S, 
) and this condition is relatively easy
to check. This yields the following proposition.
Proposition 7.23. Let the Pareto frontier of S be smooth in the point
Then, in the limit as 
goes to 1, the set of SPE utility pairs
of procedure 7.4 coincides with the limit set of procedure 7.11 if and only if the
disagreement game admits a unique Nash equilibrium and the associated pair
of Nash equilibrium utilities lie on the line piece with endpoints 
and
N(S,
).

The necessary and sufficient conditions specify a generic class of bargaining
problems that meet these conditions. This is easy to see if one realizes that
the set
need not be restricted at all for the class of (disagreement) games
where the unique pair of Nash equilibrium utilities coincides with the players
minmax levels. This is for example the case for the class of prisoners’ dilemmas.
However, there is also a large class of bargaining problems, probably larger, for
which these conditions are not met at all.
7.4.
Numerical examples
In this section two numerical examples are presented that illustrate the va-
riety of results derived in this chapter. In the first example the players’ threats
correspond to the actions in the battle-of-the-sexes game. This example shows
a multiplicity of SPE outcomes, including SPE outcomes featuring perpetual
disagreement. The disagreement actions in the second example arise from the
prisoners’ dilemma. For this example all four bargaining procedures predict
the same and unique agreement and the same threats
Example 7.24.
Consider the set

minmax value is given by 
and the corresponding minmax
strategies coincide with the mixed Nash equilibrium.
Application of theorem 7.2 and example 7.3 to Nash’s variable threat game
implies that the equilibrium threats are found by solving the zero-sum game
given by
and this game yields 
as the unique equilibrium threats. Note that these
threats do not correspond to any of the three Nash equilibria of the battle of the
sexes. The unique equilibrium agreement reached in the negotiations is given
by N (S, (0, 0)) = (5, 5). Note that the actions 
do not correspond to
Nash equilibrium actions in the battle of the sexes and that commitment to these
threats in case of a breakdown is necessary. Without commitment the players
would have an incentive to deviate.

---

Commitment and endogenous threats
199
In case the alternating offers procedure replaces the demand game, as in pro-
cedure 7.4, the equilibrium threats change to the minmax actions, e.g., propo-
sition 7.6. Here, the actions that minmax player 
coincide with the
mixed Nash equilibrium. Thus, the players threaten each other with the mixed
Nash equilibrium in case of a breakdown in every round and final agreement is
in the limit as goes to 1.
Procedure 7.8 describes Nash’s variable threat game in the absence of an en-
forcement mechanism, i.e., players lack the ability to commit themselves prior
to the negotiations. In that case, the players play one of the Nash equilibria in
case of a breakdown, which means that there are three cases to consider. First,
consider the SPE threats 
Then the SPE agreement is given by, with
some abuse of notation, 
Second, reversal of the play-
ers roles yields 
Third, the results for the mixed Nash
equilibrium case coincide with the results for the previous procedure. Which
agreement actually results depends upon the self-fulfilling prophecy of which
threats are anticipated by both players. Since the first two procedures always
predict a unique equilibrium agreement, these results hint at that commitment
plays an important role as some kind of coordination device.
Finally, consider procedure 7.11. Then the gap between a player’s worst
and best SPE agreement increases even further. 
Proposition 7.15 implies
that in, for example, player 1’s worst SPE the threats are conditioned upon
even and odd rounds. Here it is the threat of the actions 
in even
rounds and the mixed Nash equilibrium in odd rounds. These yield the con-
structed disagreement point 
with associated agreement
By symmetry, 
with associ-
ated agreement 
Theorem 7.19 then yields that the
limit set of SPE utility pairs is given by
This game is capable of generating perpetual disagreement, as described in
corollary 7.22, provided we apply it to the correlated equilibrium in which
and 
are equally probable.6 Then the associated expected
utility pair (4,4) lies in the limit set of payoffs and corollary 7.22 states that
perpetual disagreement resulting in a breakdown and threats played according
to this correlated equilibrium is a SPE outcome.

This bargaining problem satisfies the necessary and sufficient conditions of
proposition 7.23. To see this, first note that by theorem 7.2 and example 7.3 the
equilibrium threats are found by solving the zero-sum game given by
and this game yields 
as the unique equilibrium threats with utility
pair (1, 1) in the original prisoners’ dilemma. The unique equilibrium agree-
ment reached in Nash’s variable threat game is given by N (S, (1,1)) = (5, 5).
Then it is straightforward to see that for the prisoners’ dilemma both bar-
gaining procedure 7.4 and 7.11 yield the same (and unique) SPE agreement
N (S, (1, 1)) = (5, 5).
7.5. 
Related literature
Nash’s variable threat game is first analyzed in Nash (1953). This chapter
is based upon Bolt and Houba (1998), where it was first suggested to replace
the demand game by the alternating offers procedure. An analysis of Nash’s
variable threat game and its modified version without commitment can also be
found in Van Damme (1991). In Mao (1993) the question is addressed whether
or not players commit themselves if they have the freedom to do so and, in this
reference it is shown that both players do commit themselves. This references
is also the only reference that applies the H-essential equilibrium concept to the
entire two-stage negotiation procedure, which is more appropriate then applying
it to only the stage where the players play the demand game.
In this chapter the demand game is interpreted as the normal-form represen-
tation of some unspecified bargaining procedure. In Muthoo (1992) and (1996)
another interesting point of view is proposed. In these papers the demand game
is interpreted as a dynamic bargaining procedure with irrevocable commitments
to the players’ demands. As an alternative procedure a bargaining model is pre-
sented where commitments are revocable and where the players incur costs of
revoking their commitments. In this way, a unifying framework is created in
which Nash’s demand game and the alternating offers procedure both fit.
In this chapter the notion of (non)commitment is strictly reserved to whether
or not the players can commit to disagreement actions. In Fershtman and Seid-
mann (1993), Muthoo (1992) and (1996), it is argued that the alternating offers
procedure can be regarded as a bargaining procedure where the players can
make no commitments to their respective offers and in these references the
standard model is modified in order to allow for ‘partially’ revocable com-
mitments. Here, in these references, the disagreement point in the bargaining

process is assumed to be fixed and exogenously given. Therefore, they restrict
the notion of commitment to proposals and not to disagreement actions. Thus,
in these models commitment is looked upon from a different angle.

For an informal but entertaining treatment of the concept of commitment in
situations of strategic interaction we refer to Dixit and Nalebuff (1991).
This is easy to see, because in case of a linear Pareto frontier, as in example
7.3, the equilibrium threats are the Nash equilibrium actions of a true zero-
sum game and many of the early game-theoretic literature contains several
examples that admit multiple Nash equilibria.
For example, consider the game 
as the 2 × 2 bimatrix game with each
player’s payoff matrix the ‘identity’ matrix 
According to example 7.3
the set of optimal threats is the complete set A, while theorem 7.7 predicts
the unique equilibrium in symmetric mixed strategies.
The case for 
is not differentiable everywhere introduces a convex set
of disagreement point that all yield the same Nash bargaining solution, as
discussed in section 4.2.2. This case is left to the reader at this stage of the
book. For the nondifferentiable case we also refer to section 9.2.5.
If N (S,

then the second geometrical property implies that
the necessary and sufficient conditions for uniqueness are given by
where the set 
is already defined in section 4.2.2. Rewriting the in-
equalities that characterize the set 
yields less demanding conditions
for uniqueness.
There is a notationally more demanding alternative approach: Condition
the Nash equilibrium to be played upon even and odd rounds. For exam-
ple, 
at an even round and 
at an odd rounds. Then for
sufficiently large 
the same result can be obtained.
