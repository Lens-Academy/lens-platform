      The user just read about the intelligence feedback loop and recursive self-improvement.
      Check their understanding of the core dynamics: why intelligence makes it easier
      to create more intelligence, and the implications for AI development timelines.

      The user has now read Paul Christiano's perspective on recursive self-improvement
      and takeoff speeds. Compare this "slow takeoff" view with the previous readings.
      Help them understand the key disagreements about how quickly AI capabilities might advance.
