          Welcome to this lesson on the AI Revolution.

          We'll be reading Tim Urban's famous essay from Wait But Why.

          Key takeaways from this lesson:
          - Progress is exponential, not linear
          - We're currently in the ANI era
          - The AGI → ASI transition could be rapid
