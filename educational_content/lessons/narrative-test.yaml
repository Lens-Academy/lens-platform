          Welcome to this lesson on the AI Revolution.

          We'll be reading Tim Urban's famous essay from Wait But Why.
          Pay attention to the concept of "Die Progress Units" - it's a
          memorable way to think about accelerating change.

          **Reflection question:**

          Urban describes bringing someone from 1750 to today. What do you
          think would shock them most - and what might they adapt to quickly?

          The user just read about the accelerating pace of change and "Die Progress Units."

          Ask what they found most surprising about the time-travel thought experiment.
          Help them articulate the difference between linear and exponential thinking.

          Urban introduces the idea of **exponential thinking** vs **linear thinking**.

          This is one of the most common mistakes people make when predicting
          the future of AI. Let's make sure you understand it.

      - type: chat
        instructions: |
          Check the user's understanding of exponential vs linear thinking.

          Ask them to explain it in their own words. If they struggle,
          use concrete examples like rice on a chessboard or compound interest.

          The user just watched the first 3 minutes about AI history and capabilities.

          Check if they understand the ANI vs AGI distinction.
          Ask them to give examples of each type.

          ## Summary

          Key takeaways from this lesson:
          - Progress is exponential, not linear
          - We're currently in the ANI era
          - The AGI → ASI transition could be rapid
